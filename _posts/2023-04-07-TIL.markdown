Swift on Windows is bizarre. Updated Swift to 5.8 and Swift Package Manager stopped to work. I have openned [issue](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/issues/6387).

Documentation at https://www.swift.org/getting-started/ has paragraph how to repair:

> Repairing after Visual Studio Updates
> If Visual Studio is updated, you may have to repair the installation. See Microsoft’s [instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/repair-apps-and-programs-in-windows-10-e90eefe4-d0a2-7c1b-dd59-949a9030f317) for repairing installed programs.

It's not clear exactly what has to be "repaired" and how.

Here are the steps.

* Launch **Control Panel**.
* In **Control Panel** launch **Programs and Features**.
* In **Programs and Features** find **Swift Developer Package for Windows x86_64**.
* Right click on **Swift Developer Package for Windows x86_64** and click **Change** in contectual menu.
* In launched installer click **Repair** and follow instructions.

After these steps `swift build` builds package normally.
