Jumped to [swift-sh](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh) a tool which allows to write CLI in Swift with dependencies.

```swift
#!/usr/bin/swift sh

import Foundation
import PromiseKit  // @mxcl ~> 6.5
print("That is how it works üëÜüèø")
```

Nice gists of all sessions in [WWDC 2019 Session Notes](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC).

Great idea to store app container and use in tests [one small change for Xcode, one giant leap for productivity](http://mohsen.dev/2019/05/19/one-small-change-for-xcode-one-giant-leap-for-productivity.html).

Xcode 11 Previews could be used without SwiftUI and while developing for iOS versions prior to 13: [Using Xcode Previews with existing views without using SwiftUI](https://www.avanderlee.com/xcode/xcode-previews/).
