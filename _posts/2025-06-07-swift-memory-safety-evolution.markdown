Discovered new [keyword `unsafe`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/3a96d085c72895fcca9049baa145eed8434244b7/stdlib/public/core/CString.swift#L368).

Read [Opt-in Strict Memory Safety Checking](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0458-strict-memory-safety.md) Swift evolution proposal which introduces `unsafe` keyword.

TIL Swift evolution repo contains [`visions` folder](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/tree/main/visions)

Read post [The role of vision documents in Swift evolution](https://forums.swift.org/t/the-role-of-vision-documents-in-swift-evolution) in Swift forums.
