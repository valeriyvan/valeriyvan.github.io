Read interesting repo Lickability [Swift Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-best-practices/). "Read repo" sounds funny, I know. Lickability is small app agency from NY.

It [describes app architecture](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-best-practices/blob/master/CombinedDocument.md). Especially interesting [Common Controller Types](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-best-practices/blob/master/CommonControllerTypes.md). It contain a lot of interesting and important things even about Project Groups in Xcode project. So it could be good reference point.
