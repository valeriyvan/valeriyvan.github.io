Browsed quite wordy and detailed post [Using Google Cloud Translation API to Power Your iOS App with Instant Translation](https://www.appcoda.com/google-translation-api). Post worth keeping a bookmark. Quite good following of MVVM architecture.

Above post mentions [`GTAlertCollection`](https://github.com/gabrieltheodoropoulos/gtalertcollection) which worth keeping a bookmark and using. Unfortunately neither Carthage nor CocoaPods is supported.

Fun post about loading animation [Everything you need to know about Loading Animations](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/everything-you-need-to-know-about-loading-animations-10db7f9b61e).

From [A Better Syntax for Configurable Initializations](https://mackarous.com/dev/2019/1/23/a-better-syntax-for-configurable-initializations) TIL what is a configurable initialization?. I don't like solution. I find [Then](https://github.com/devxoul/Then) much consistent.
