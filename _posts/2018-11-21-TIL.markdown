Read Natasha the Robot's post [Swift: When to use guard vs if](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-when-to-use-guard-vs-if/). Her approach pretty much matches mine. Reading article I have found `"Coffee Break".localized()` which I should definitely use!

Watched [Everything a Swift Dev Needs to Know About Machine Learning](https://academy.realm.io/posts/swift-developer-on-machine-learning-try-swift-2017-gallagher/). Didn't worth spending time. The only output - references on [Videos of Siraj that shows a lot of simple projects made with just a few lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) and [Tutorials of Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).
