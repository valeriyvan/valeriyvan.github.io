Read [From ground to FPV drone: introduction (russian)](https://habr.com/ru/post/486076/). Will return to it later.

Todo: I should definitely create playground for various pointers:

```
Swift                               C
UnsafePointer<T>              const T&ast;

UnsafeRawPointer              const void&ast;

UnsafeMutablePointer<T>          T&ast;

UnsafeMutableRawPointer          void&ast;

UnsafeMutableBufferPointer
```

Read [Control UI with gestures (Keras + CoreML)(russian)](https://habr.com/ru/post/487158/). Simple guide. I should follow it.
