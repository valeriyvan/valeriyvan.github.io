TIL Snippets in Swift packages: [Getting started with SwiftPM Snippets](https://swiftonserver.com/getting-started-with-swiftpm-snippets/). Read also [A critical look at Swift Snippets (Swift 5.7)](https://blog.eidinger.info/a-critical-look-at-swift-snippets-swift-57). I will definitely use this feature. Documentation for Snippet feature is missing, [Swift Snippets Swift forums thread](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-snippets/51947) is the best documentation replacement. Here is my first snippet [chessboard-ppm.swift](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize/blob/main/Snippets/chessboard-ppm.swift).

I see [A card displaying a ``Snippet`` at the terminal](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/pull/3694/files) in sources of Swift Package manager. How to use this stuff?

TIL [swift-identified-collections](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-identified-collections) which fits nicely with SwiftUI.

TIL [swift-composable-architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

TIL [Swift Collections Benchmark](https://github.com/apple/swift-collections-benchmark). I should use this.

Read [High Performance Swift Apps](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/high-performance-swift-apps) by Jacob's Tech Tavern.

TIL there's SwiftUI-like frameworks for terminal: [TerminalUI](https://github.com/chriseidhof/TerminalUI), [SwiftTUI](https://github.com/rensbreur/SwiftTUI).

TIL [console-kit](https://github.com/vapor/console-kit) which is used by Vapor.
