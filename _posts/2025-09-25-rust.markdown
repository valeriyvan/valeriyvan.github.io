Read [Apple is quietly rewriting iOS and it’s not in Swift or Objective-C](https://medium.com/@devlinktips/apple-is-quietly-rewriting-ios-and-its-not-in-swift-or-objective-c-4af4dc578775).

Browsed [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html) book, [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code, [Rustlings web version](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org).

Started watching [ULTIMATE Rust Lang Tutorial! - Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX9HJsJUDxA&list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8).
