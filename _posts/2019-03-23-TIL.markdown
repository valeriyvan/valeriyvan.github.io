Read [UTF-8 String](https://swift.org/blog/utf8-string) about Swift 5 the preferred encoding of strings from UTF-16 to UTF-8 while preserving efficient Objective-C-interoperability.

Watched [a talk on Swift for TensorFlow by Chris Lattner and Brennan Saeta given at Dev Summit 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s65BigoMV_I).

Passed over [swift-log, a Logging API package for Swift 5](https://github.com/apple/swift-log).

> a community-driven open-source project which is actively seeking contributions, be it code, documentation, or ideas. 

Hope [Key Path Expressions as Functions](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0249-key-path-expressions-as-functions/21780) proposal will be accepted.
