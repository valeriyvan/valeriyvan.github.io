[Handling Cocoa Errors in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/cocoa_design_patterns/handling_cocoa_errors_in_swift). Finally found out how to catch only specific errors when making file operations, e.g. not throw if file doesn't exist when deleting file:

```swift
do {
    try fileManager.moveItem(at: fromURL, to: toURL)
} catch CocoaError.fileNoSuchFile {
    print("Error: no such file exists")
} catch CocoaError.fileReadUnsupportedScheme {
    print("Error: unsupported scheme (should be 'file://')")
}
```
