Trying to build telegram bot for geometrizing images using my swift package [swift-geometrize](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize) as dependency I came across error:
```
error: Dependencies could not be resolved because root depends on 'swift-geometrize' 0.0.0..<1.0.0.
'swift-geometrize' cannot be used because no versions of 'swift-geometrize' match the requirement {0.0.0..<0.9.0, 0.9.1..<1.0.0} and package 'swift-geometrize' is required using a stable-version but 'swift-geometrize' depends on an unstable-version package 'jpeg'.
```

From this I have learned that Swift Package manager treats dependencies based on branch unstable version because branch means variable version.
