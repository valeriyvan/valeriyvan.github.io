Watched [WWDC 2021 session video Meet async/await in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10132/).

Whaaaaat? [UIImage has async method `prepareThumbnail(of:completionHandler:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/3750845-preparethumbnail). How could I miss that!?
