Hm. I understood hash in Cartfile as [requirement of exact version with commit specified by its hash](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#version-requirement). Why then it gets updated with `carthage update`?

This might be Swift interview question: "What's result of `-9 % 4`? I didn't know about difference between module and remainder.
