Was caught with this quiz answering it wrong. And most developers answer it wrong. Appearance of default case should have made this suspicious! Nice interview question.

Read NSHipster's [`UIStackView`](https://nshipster.com/uistackview/) post. Quite good explanation. Despite I use UIStackView in nearly every app I develop, I have found something new in the post. I have missed this:

> To remove an arranged subview that you no longer want around, you need to call `removeFromSuperview()` on it. The stack view will automatically remove it from the arranged subview list. In contrast, calling `removeArrangedSubview(_ view: UIView)` on the stack view will only remove the view passed as a parameter from the arranged subview list, without removing it from the subview hierarchy. Keep this distinction in mind if you are modifying the stack view content during runtime.

Nice post [`CAEmitterLayer`](https://nshipster.com/caemitterlayer/) about confetti effect. Would wait promised full code to give it a try.

Passed over [TensorFlow and CoreML â€“ inference on iOS](https://medium.com/@chrisparsonsdev/tensorflow-and-coreml-inference-on-ios-2dbe31756bef).

Passed over post [Hotswapping Core ML models on the iPhone](https://corp.zedge.net/developers-blog/hotswapping-machine-learning-models-in-coreml-for-iphone) which describes quite sophisticated techniques of deploying CoreML models.
