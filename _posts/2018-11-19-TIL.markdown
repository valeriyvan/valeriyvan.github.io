While working on PRs to [Aerial](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial) spent some time exploring why `UserDefaults` has to call `synchronize` (contrary to what is stated [Developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults/1414005-synchronize)) before closing [ScreenSaverView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/screensaver/screensaverview). Hope to write a post about this.
