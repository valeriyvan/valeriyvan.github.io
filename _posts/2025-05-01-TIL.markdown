TIL [adwaita-swift](https://git.aparoksha.dev/aparoksha/adwaita-swift) advertised in blog post [Writing GNOME Apps with Swift](https://www.swift.org/blog/adwaita-swift/) on [Swift.org](https://www.swift.org/) is bullshit. I wasn't able to run any demo app on Ubuntu. Filed a bug [adwaita-swift build error](https://git.aparoksha.dev/aparoksha/adwaita-swift/issues/60).


That why I have started to look other SwiftUI-like cross platform frameworks. TIL [swift-cross-ui](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui). This failed on step of installing `swift-bundler`. Filed a bug [Installing on Ubuntu 22.04 fails](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler/issues/74). Maintainer has given suggestion in issue how to install `swift-bundler`.

TIL `apt` is just a newer version of `apt-get`: [Whatâ€™s the Difference Between APT and APT-GET?](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-apt-and-apt-get/). Linux is pain. `brew install libadwaita` terminated with error 

``
`==> Pouring llvm--20.1.3.x86_64_linux.bottle.tar.gz
Error: Too many open files @ rb_sysopen - /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/llvm/20.1.3/bin/llvm-lto
```


TIL uninstalling packages in `apt` and `apt-get` is done with `remove` instead of expected `uninstall`, like `sudo apt uninstall libadwaita-1-dev libgtk-4-dev`.

TIL how to check Ubuntu version in command line: `lsb_release -a`:

```bash
$>lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
Release:	22.04
Codename:	jammy
```

TIL [Homebrew could be used on Linux as well](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux).


At the end of the day I succeeded with running first UI app on Ubuntu written in Swift:
