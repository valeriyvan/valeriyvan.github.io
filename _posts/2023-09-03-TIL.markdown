Watched once again [Betaflight for Beginners | The settings you need to get your drone in the air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEo19JtVe1U).

Some notes for future self.

GPS didn't want to start working. 

Set baud rate taken from GPS module datasheet:

Set protocol from same datasheet:

It stays unclear how do I setup TX/RX channels for GPS and radio receiver if at all. I set GPS receiver and radio receiver on lines which match RX/TX channels where they are soldered. But that UART channels, not RX/TX channels.

Finally everything worked and I firstly got self built drone in the air:
