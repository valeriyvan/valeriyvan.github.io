Should [ask Apple a question](https://developer.apple.com/events/ask-apple/) about returning from Objective-C function autoreleased Core Graphics object.

Came accross [swift-tagged](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-tagged) package. Simple thing like `typealias Id = Tagged<User, Int>` makes types unique.
