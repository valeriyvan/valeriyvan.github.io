Came across following [tweet](https://x.com/DanielcHooper/status/1800267354552582257): It's weird how Apple continues to double down on Swift when even the language's creator says that the type system design is flawed: fundamentally slow and impossible to provide good error messages for. Thread refers to video [MojoðŸ”¥: a deep dive on ownership with Chris Lattner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ag0fPMmYPQ&t=373s). Interesting part starts from 6m 13s. It mentions that Swift expression type checker is slow and error message cumbersome. Thread also mentions Zig programming language. I like how Zig positions itself: 

> A Simple Language
>
> Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge.
>
> No hidden control flow.
> No hidden memory allocations.
> No preprocessor, no macros.
