Read [Identifiable](https://nshipster.com/identifiable/) at NSHipster. Not as useless reading as one might think. Post discusses topics like Identifiable vs. Equatable, Identifiable vs. Hashable.

* Unlike identifiers, hash values are typically _state-dependent_, changing when an object is mutated.

* Identifiers are _stable_ across launches, whereas hash values are calculated by randomly generated hash seeds, making them _unstable_ between launches.

Identifiers are _unique_, whereas hash values may _collide_, requiring additional equality checks when fetched from a collection.

Identifiers can be _meaningful_, whereas hash values are chaotic by virtue of their hashing functions.

NSHipster's posts are always gold!

Jumped to [Versions of Universally unique identifier in WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Versions). Apple uses Version 4 for UUID. Did know that all UUIDs have version number in them.

> As in other UUIDs, 4 bits are used to indicate version 4.

Jumped to [Hashable / Hasher](https://nshipster.com/hashable/).

Exercise: Use sequence function to walk tree.

Sidenote: [About here in LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iurimatsuura/) is really good! I should learn from this.
