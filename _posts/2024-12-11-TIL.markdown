Started to read a book [A philosophy of software design by John Ousterhout](/assets/images/Book%20A%20philosophy%20of%20software%20design%20by%20John%20Ousterhout.jpeg). I like it's less than 200 pages.

Read [ChatGPT in Xcode: is it good?](https://www.swiftwithvincent.com/blog/chatgpt-in-xcode-is-it-good).
