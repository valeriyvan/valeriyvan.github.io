Read [Benchmarking Xcode Performance on a large Swift Project. iMac, MacBook, iMac Pro compared](https://maximeremenko.com/benchmarking-xcode-performance-using-swift-imac-macbook-comparison). Comparison is curious. Conclusion that size of memory, 16Gb, 32Gb or 64Gb isn't that important also curious.
