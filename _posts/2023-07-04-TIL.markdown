TIL [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects).

TIL how to copy files to s3 bucket with cli: `aws s3 cp /path/to/file s3://bucket-name`.

TIL that [`URLSessionConfiguration` has property `waitsForConnectivity`](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/networking/how-to-make-a-network-request-wait-for-an-internet-connection-using-waitsforconnectivity). By default, the system will wait seven days to see if internet connectivity becomes available, but it can be controlled with the `timeoutIntervalForResource` property on configuration.
