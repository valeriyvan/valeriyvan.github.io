TIL `alloca` function in C to dynamically allocate memory on stack. Also learned it's extremely unsafe and is discouraged to use.

> `alloca()` is machine and compiler dependent; its use is discouraged.

> `alloca()` is slightly unsafe because it cannot ensure that the pointer returned points to a valid and usable block of memory.  The allocation made may exceed the bounds of the stack, or even go further into other objects in memory, and `alloca()` cannot determine such an error.  Avoid `alloca()` with large unbounded allocations.

> The use of C99 variable-length arrays and `alloca()` in the same function will cause the lifetime of alloca's storage to be limited to the block containing the `alloca()`.
