TIL Adwaita - a framework for creating user interfaces for GNOME with an API similar to SwiftUI: [Writing GNOME Apps with Swift](https://www.swift.org/blog/adwaita-swift/).

TIL that Storage section in Settings for Mac allows to clean up storage without third party apps:

E.g. Developer section allows to clean up much more the [Xcode DevCleaner](https://github.com/vashpan/xcode-dev-cleaner) which I used to use for this purpose:

It also shows that 2.67GB caches of Command Line Tools could be clean up but for whatever reason Delete button is inactive:

It also has shown more then year old 22.28GB iOS backup about which I forgotten:
