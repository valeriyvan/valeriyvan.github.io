Read post [Struct References](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/references/) by Chris Aidhof.

Read review by Chris Eidhof [Swift Analytics](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/swift-analytics/) about building analytics system in Swift with enums, structs, protocols and subclasses.

Browsed post by Cris Eidhof [Swift Mirrors and JSON](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/swift-mirrors-and-json/) about using reflection to build JSON codable. Post mentions library doing exactly this [](https://github.com/matthewcheok/JSONCodable).

And finally with Cris, read [Undo History in Swift](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/undo-history-in-swift/).

Jumped to [BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/blas?changes=_2) which is part of Accelerate framework. Jumped because we have been discussing if BLAS could help me with my current task of interpreting CoreML model output. The answer is "No".

Read about [Compression](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/compression?changes=_2), part of Accelerate framework.
