Watched Swift talk about [string interpolation in Swift 5](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E143-string-interpolation-in-swift-5). Yes, Swift 5 is coming.

Read very old post of Natasha The Robot [Swift: What are Protocols with Associated Types?](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-what-are-protocols-with-associated-types/).

> Thatâ€™s it! A protocol with associated type is just a fancy term to a protocol that has generics in it. By using PATs (and protocols in general), we have a powerful tool that promotes really nice composition in favor of messy inheritance.

Then watched Alexis Gallagher's talk [Protocols with Associated Types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWoNjiSPqI8). Very good explanation of what Protocols with associated types are.

> Are Protocols with associated types just generic protocols with wacky syntax? No. And yes, sort of.
