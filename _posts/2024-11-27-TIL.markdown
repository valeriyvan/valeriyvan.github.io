Read about libraries/frameworks on Apple platforms: [Static, Dynamic, Mergeable, oh, my!](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/static-dynamic-mergeable-oh-my).

> If you want to embarrass a senior iOS engineer, ask them to explain the difference between Dynamic Frameworks and Static Libraries.

> These concepts are enormously important, but for years, they were packaged up in a box in my brain labelled “I’ll learn about these one day, but until then, I’ll have impostor syndrome”.

> Unless you’re working to reduce app bundle size, simplify your dependency graph, optimise launch performance, or speed up build times, you won’t get to put this knowledge into practice.

> Let’s change that with a primer on libraries, frameworks, and linking, and then let’s understand what is meant by **static** and **dynamic**. We’ll finish by learning about the new mergeable libraries available in Xcode.
