Learned how to [turn on Gather coverage](https://cocoacasts.com/how-to-enable-code-coverage-in-xcode) in Xcode. I always forget where this should be turned on.

Do you know `expandingTildeInPath` exists for `NSString` but not for `String`. `URL` has `standardizedFileURL` but it isn't doing what you would expect. The easiest way fill gap - bridge to `NSString`:

```swift
let expandedPath = (CommandLine.arguments[1] as NSString).expandingTildeInPath
let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: expandedPath)
``` 

TODO: add here explanation of what is `standardizedFileURL` really doing. And use `NSString` initializer instead of cast.
