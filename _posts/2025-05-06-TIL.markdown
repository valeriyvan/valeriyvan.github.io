[How to avoid calling `CustomStringConvertible.description` as a property?](https://forums.swift.org/t/how-to-avoid-calling-customstringconvertible-description-as-a-property/72605)

[](https://swiftinit.org/docs/swift/swift/customstringconvertible.description) Calling `description` property directly is discouraged.

> Hmm. It's interesting that CustomStringConvertible doesn't mention why String(describing:) is the preferred method of converting a value of Any type to a String.

> Calling this property directly is discouraged. Instead, convert an instance of any type to a string by using the `String(describing:)` initializer. This initializer works with any type, and uses the custom description property for types that conform to `CustomStringConvertible`.
