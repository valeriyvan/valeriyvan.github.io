Succeeded with running first app build with [SwiftCrossUI](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui) on Ubuntu:

But one step aside from Examples, and it fails: [Picker crashes app on Ubuntu](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui).

TIL [the-swift-collective](https://github.com/the-swift-collective), a growing collection of cross platform swift packages.
