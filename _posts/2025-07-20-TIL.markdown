TIL about [VTX tools](https://vtx.in.ua) — a collection of handy tools for drone enthusiasts. It includes a VTX config generator, RX/VTX catalog with config generation features, various calculators, and even a tool for extracting useful data from ELRS firmware. A great resource if you're working with FPV gear.

Also read Peter Steinberger’s blog post: [Slot Machines for Programmers: How Peter Builds Apps 20x Faster with AI](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/when-ai-meets-madness-peters-16-hour-days).

He uses the [Wispr Flow](https://x.com/WisprFlow) app to dictate long-form prompts with voice - an interesting workflow!
