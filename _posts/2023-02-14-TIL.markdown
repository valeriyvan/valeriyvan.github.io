TIL [JetBrains Sunsetting AppCode](https://blog.jetbrains.com/appcode/2022/12/appcode-2022-3-release-and-end-of-sales-and-support/).

Today I have subscribed for GitHub [Copilot](https://github.com/github-copilot/). Installed [CopilotForXcode plugin](https://github.com/intitni/CopilotForXcode). Activated Copilot also for NVIM and Visual Studio Code. Latter looks quite nice. I will try to use it some time. As for NVIM, I worked with it's maintainer, Justin some years ago. Since then I have NVIM installed but never really used it for something bigger then editing tiny config files.
