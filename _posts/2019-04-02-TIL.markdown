Read [Different flavors of type erasure in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/different-flavors-of-type-erasure-in-swift) by John Sundell. It refined my understanding of Swift protocols having `Self` or associated type requirements and what makes Swift protocols different from Objective-C ones.

Post explains three flavors of type erasure:
* Generic wrapper types;
* Type erasure with closures; 👈🏿 I favor this.
* External specialization.

Read [Avoiding race conditions in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/avoiding-race-conditions-in-swift) by John Sundell because previous post had a link to it.
