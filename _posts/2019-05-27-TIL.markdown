Read [Alex Denisov's](https://github.com/AlexDenisov) post [BITCODE DEMYSTIFIED](https://lowlevelbits.org/bitcode-demystified/). What I have learned from it:

* Bitcode is a bitstream representation of LLVM IR;
* LLVM IR is intermediate representation of LLVM;
* Mach-O (format for iOS and OS X executables) file has segment with compressed bitcode;
* AppStore does thinning striping segments for other platforms (CPUs) but not for all iOS versions.

Read [How OS X Executes Applications](http://0xfe.blogspot.com/2006/03/how-os-x-executes-applications.html).

* In order to get a list of dependencies for an executable on OS X, you need to use `otool`. Here I can see that `/bin/ls` references three dynamic libraries:

```bash
otool -L /bin/ls
/bin/ls:
	/usr/lib/libutil.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib (compatibility version 5.4.0, current version 5.4.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1319.100.3)
```
