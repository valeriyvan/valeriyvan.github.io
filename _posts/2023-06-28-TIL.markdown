TIL a bit about [Real-Time Transport Protocol (often referred to as RTP streaming)](https://www.wowza.com/blog/rtp-streaming-explained) and [Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol).

TIL about remote desktop [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com). Will not use it as it installs on macOS startup items which I don't like.

TIL [`ssh-copy-id`](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id). Here's command to be used: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey user@host`. I used to copy `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` manually from machine to machine. It founds out that I should have copied key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, not to `~/.ssh/`.

Read [A Survey on Open-Source Simulation Platforms for Multi-Copter UAV Swarms](/assets/images/Paper%20A%20Survey%20on%20Open-Source%20Simulation%20Platforms%20for%20Multi-Copter%20UAV%20Swarms.pdf).

Downloaded and installed the first one, [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com). It could be launched as CLI `/Applications/Webots.app/Contents/MacOS/webots --help`.
