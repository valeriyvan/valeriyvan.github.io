Read again Chapter 2 of Machine learning with Core ML book. Which ended up with [bug fix](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-with-Core-ML/pull/10).

Read [Identifying objects in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/identifying-objects-in-swift). It's about `Equatable`, `===`, `Hashable` and ... `ObjectIdentifier`. Have never head of `ObjectIdentifier`!!!

Read [Code encapsulation in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/code-encapsulation-in-swift).
