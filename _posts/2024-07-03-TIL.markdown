TIL `git checkout -`. The minus (-) at the end of the command tells `git` to switch to the previous branch you were on before the current one. It's a way to quickly toggle back and forth between two branches without needing to type out the full branch names.

TIL `pushd` and `popd`: [`git worktree` example](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree#_examples):

```bash
$ git worktree add -b emergency-fix ../temp master
$ pushd ../temp
# ... hack hack hack ...
$ git commit -a -m 'emergency fix for boss'
$ popd
$ git worktree remove ../temp
```

TIL about [Typed throws](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0413-typed-throws.md) in Swift.
