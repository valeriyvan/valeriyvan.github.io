Read accepted Swift evolution proposal [Type placeholders (formerly, "Placeholder types")](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0315-placeholder-types.md).

Read post [Using tuples to Complex Sorting Operations in Swift](https://holyswift.app/using-tuples-to-complex-sorting-operations-in-swift). The idea is brilliant.
