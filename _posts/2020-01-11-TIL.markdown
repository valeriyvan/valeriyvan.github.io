Read [New Diagnostic Architecture Overview](https://swift.org/blog/new-diagnostic-arch-overview/). Understood very little. Got that soon to be released Swift 5.2 will have much better diagnostic.

I should play in playground on this stackoverflow answer [Round trip Swift number types to/from Data](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38024025/942513). Very good and detailed answer!
