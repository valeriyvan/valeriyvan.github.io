TIL that in C++ it's possible to declare variable [inside of condition in `if`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/22eeac637114bd0d9553853e8550b8224312692e/stdlib/public/CommandLineSupport/CommandLine.cpp#L92):
```C++
// Try the platform-specific fast path that avoids heap (re)allocation. Not
// all platforms implement this function.
if (auto argv = swift::getUnsafeArgvArgc(outArgLen)) {
  return argv;
}
```

The first fixes [1](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/62661), [2](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/62676), [3](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/62693/files) in Swift thanks to [PVS-Studio](https://pvs-studio.com/en/).
