TIL that [Ubuntu cannot be installed from packages on Raspberry Pi Zero v1](https://askubuntu.com/a/703071), but [on v2 can](https://askubuntu.com/a/1383831). But [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org) could be installed on both. That works for me.

Played with [GPIO on Jetson](https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio). I could blink with LED connected to GPIO (plus of LED connected to GPIO, minus over resistor 330 Ohm - to ground). But reading button state didn't work for me (one pin of button is connected to GPIO, another over same resistor - to 3.3V pin).
