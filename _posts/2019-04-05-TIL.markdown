Watched [Swift Talk #146 Markdown Playgrounds: Markdown Syntax Highlighting](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E146-markdown-syntax-highlighting). Nothing interesting this time.

Read John Sundell's [Swift sequences: The art of being lazy](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/swift-sequences-the-art-of-being-lazy). It's about using `Sequence` and `AnySequence`.
