Learned how to install/use Sublime Text on Windows. Forgotten experience for me. Most of time nowdays I have access only to Windows computer. But it doesn't stop me from learning. 

Read [Swift forum thread Introduce embedded development using Swift](https://forums.swift.org/t/introduce-embedded-development-using-swift/56573/). Very interesting reading.

Read [On the road to Swift 6](https://forums.swift.org/t/on-the-road-to-swift-6/32862).

Read [Swift Numerics](https://www.swift.org/blog/numerics/) which introduces `Real` and `Complex`. And in future it's supposed to add [`ShapedArray`](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics/issues/6) - equivalent of numpy's `ndarray`, [Fixed-size integers larger than `Int64`](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics/issues/4) (some time ago I wanted to use Int128 and was surprised there's no such type in Swift).

From one of above leared about [μSwift](https://github.com/compnerd/uswift).

Read [C Isn't A Programming Language Anymore](https://gankra.github.io/blah/c-isnt-a-language/). "C is an inscrutable implementation-defined mess". "C is the lingua franca of programming." Target triples, like `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`.

Side-reading [What's wrong with Raspberry Pi (in Russian)](https://habr.com/ru/post/440584/) about (Microsoft own closed sourced) [ThreadX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreadX) real-time OS which runs Raspberri Pi under the hood.

Starting experimenting with [Websites using Swift and AWS Lambda](https://jasonzurita.com/websites-using-swift-and-aws-lambda/).
