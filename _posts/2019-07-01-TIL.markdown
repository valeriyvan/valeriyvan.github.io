Continuing fucking with [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org)came across this [gist](https://gist.github.com/ricpacca/652ab90ba3a5754e980c78d6634b84a0) which worked for me. Learned that importing 'complex.h' one could use expressions like `double complex z1 = 1.0 + 3.0 * I;` in plain C (taken from this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9860772/942513)). It's C99. [Same works in C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/complex). Finally found out that failure last Friday was not because of `complex.h` being to included but because of my buffer overflow bug.

Examining [fftw documentation](http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Row_002dmajor-Format.html#Row_002dmajor-Format) found a term I havn't heard before - row-major order for multidimensional array (sometimes called “C order”). Also [exists a column-major order](http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Column_002dmajor-Format.html#Column_002dmajor-Format) (sometimes called “Fortran order”).

TODO: [check](http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Reversing-array-dimensions.html#Reversing-array-dimensions) is it really that despite row-major or column-major order both can be accessed just by changing order of dimensions.
