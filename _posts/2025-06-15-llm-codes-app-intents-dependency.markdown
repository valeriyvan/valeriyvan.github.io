TIL [llm.codes](https://llm.codes) online tool for transforming developer documentation to clean, LLM-friendly Markdown. It didn't fork smooth for me so I have opened issue [Loose some information, de-indent snippet, mix structure](https://github.com/amantus-ai/llm-codes/issues/3).

Read Apple documentation [Displaying static and interactive snippets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/displaying-static-and-interactive-snippets): "Enable people to view the outcome of an app intent and immediately perform follow-up actions". Sample app: [Adopting App Intents to support system experiences](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences). I didn't understand what exactly it is but have feeling I need this for my new app.

Came across `@Dependency` in sample code. Googled for it: [How to use @Dependency for non-TCA Dependency Injection](https://forums.swift.org/t/how-to-use-dependency-for-non-tca-dependency-injection/60290).
