Attended meetup [Image segmentation with deep learning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ft6fv9XBtMgK0OISEAgcmxp24yvXHOIvil9M-CJ2z7g/edit?usp=sharing). Learned difference between semantic segmentation vs instance segmentation. [withoutbg.com](https://withoutbg.com) and [segmentive.ai](https://www.segmentive.ai) - very good examples of what could be done.
