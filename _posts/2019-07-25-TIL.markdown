Read [Reducing Memory Footprint and OOM Terminations in iOS](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/techniques-to-reduce-memory-footprint-and-oom-terminations-in-ios-a0f6bef38217). OOM stands for Out Of memory.

Bookmarking github repo [Awesome-Swift-Playgrounds](https://github.com/uraimo/Awesome-Swift-Playgrounds). May be I should create playground for Fast Fourier Transform and Short Time Fourier Transform.
