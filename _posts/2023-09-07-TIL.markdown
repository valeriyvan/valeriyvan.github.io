TIL `-X` option to enable X Windows forwarding [X Windows Forwarding on Mac OS X](http://www.dba-oracle.com/t_linux_x_windows_mac_os.htm). X Windows has to be installed on local Mac. I downloaded  [X11 for Mac OS X 1.0](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL641?locale=en_GB) from Apple. But after launching it says it's from unidettified developers.
