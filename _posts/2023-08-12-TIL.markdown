TIL how to setup WiFi on Raspberry Pi. The first one could be adjusted with Raspberry Pi Imager mention above. Later new SSID could be added with `raspi-config`.

TIL CLI for macOS to list WiFi SSID in terminal: `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -I`. [Source - stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4481019).
