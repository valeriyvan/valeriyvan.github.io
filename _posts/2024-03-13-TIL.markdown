Read and tried [How to display a WebView in SwiftUI](https://asynclearn.medium.com/how-to-display-a-webview-in-swiftui-d60b4bff6ba7). I have found that SwiftUI's `Text` become slow for showing big real life documents so I tried switching back to `WKWebView`. I found `WKWebView` is extremely fast in comparison with SwiftUI `Text`.
