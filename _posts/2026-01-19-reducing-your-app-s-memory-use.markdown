Read Apple's documentation [Reducing your app’s memory use](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/reducing-your-app-s-memory-use) and old but still interesting [Memory Usage Performance Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/ManagingMemory.html).

TIL what is jetsam: [Identifying high-memory use with jetsam event reports](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/identifying-high-memory-use-with-jetsam-event-reports).
