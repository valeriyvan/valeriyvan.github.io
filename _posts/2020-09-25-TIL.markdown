Read Max Desiatov post [The state of Swift for WebAssembly in 2020 (and earlier)](https://desiatov.com/swift-webassembly-2020/). Learned that [asm.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js) was superseeded by [WebAssembly (often shortened to Wasm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly).

TODO: Xcode sucks to fix this:

```Objective-C
CGSize size = [self.valueLabel.text sizeWithFont:self.valueLabel.font
                               constrainedToSize:CGSizeMake(self.valueLabel.frame.size.width, MAXFLOAT)
                                   lineBreakMode:NSLineBreakByWordWrapping];
```
