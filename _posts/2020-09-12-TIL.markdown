Watched Building Reactive Applications With Combine [What Is Reactive Programming](https://cocoacasts.com/building-reacting-applications-with-combine-what-is-reactive-programming), then [Combine First-Class Functions and Function Types](https://cocoacasts.com/building-reacting-applications-with-combine-first-class-functions-and-function-types) and [Pure Functions and Higher-Order Functions](https://cocoacasts.com/building-reacting-applications-with-combine-pure-functions-and-higher-order-functions). Nothing new in either.

Watched Tips and Tricks: [Removing String Literals](https://cocoacasts.com/tips-and-tricks-removing-string-literals), then [Using a Branching Strategy That Works](https://cocoacasts.com/tips-and-tricks-using-a-branching-strategy-that-works). Nothing new in both.

Watched Tips and Tricks: [Using didSet Property Observers to Configure Outlets](https://cocoacasts.com/tips-and-tricks-using-didset-property-observers-to-configure-outlets). Completely makes sense!

Watched [Why You Should Default to Private Outlets](https://cocoacasts.com/tips-and-tricks-why-you-should-default-to-private-outlets). Obvious.

Watched [Five Simple Tips to Improve the Code You Write](https://cocoacasts.com/tips-and-tricks-five-simple-tips-to-improve-the-code-you-write). The first tip suggesting using switch instead of if statement with boolean condition I find stupid. The rest tips make sense.

Watched [Ten Xcode Tricks Every Developer Should Know](https://cocoacasts.com/tips-and-tricks-ten-xcode-tricks-every-developer-should-know). Tip of showing callers in assistant editor is useful.

Watched [Managing Build Configurations in Xcode](https://cocoacasts.com/tips-and-tricks-managing-build-configurations-in-xocde). This is extremely useful!
