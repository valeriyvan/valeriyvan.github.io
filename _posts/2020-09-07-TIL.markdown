Watched [Mastering MVVM With Swift: How Does the Model-View-ViewModel Pattern Work](https://cocoacasts.com/how-does-mvvm-work).

Learned what is called self executing closure [Tips and Tricks:
What Are Self-Executing Closures](https://cocoacasts.com/tips-and-tricks-what-are-self-executing-closures). Sure, concept isn't new. I just haven't known how it's called. But some ideas of how it could be used are new.

Came across [Writing A Generic Stable Sort](https://airspeedvelocity.net/2016/01/10/writing-a-generic-stable-sort/). I feel I was already there.

Digging in Swift stdlib sources have found how `UTF8` is accessible despite it's declared in `Unicode`:

```
public typealias UTF8 = Unicode.UTF8
public typealias UTF16 = Unicode.UTF16
public typealias UTF32 = Unicode.UTF32
```
