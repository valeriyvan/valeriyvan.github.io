*Swift meetup question:* if would like to mention a method of a class in Objective-C in text I do it so `-[Class method:parameter]` or `+[Class method:parameter]` if it's about a class method. How should I do this in case of Swift? If I write `Class.method(_parameter:)` it is not clear is it about method of a class or an instance.
