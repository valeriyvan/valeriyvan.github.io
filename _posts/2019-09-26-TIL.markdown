In Objective-C or C when you need to process buffer from somewhere in its middle, you do something like `&signalFloats[offset]` or `signalFloats + offset`. When you do `&signalFloats[offset]` in Swift, compiler is happy because types match, but you get something completely different by meaning. `signalFloats[offset]` returns a copy of a value from an array because it's value type and `&` takes address of this value.
