Passed over [Useful obscure Foundation types in Swift](https://swiftrocks.com/useful-obscure-foundation-types-in-swift.html). Well. I have used 'NSScanner' 10 years ago or so for [this](https://gist.github.com/valeriyvan/a70e8af69662ed58caef). TODO: rewrite that in Swift. [`CFBinaryHeap`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfbinaryheap?language=objc) and [`CFTree`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cftree?language=objc) are new for me. Have heard but never used [`NSCache`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscache?language=objc), [`NSOrderedSet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsorderedset?language=objc), [`NSByteCountFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsbytecountformatter), [`NSDataDetector`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatadetector?language=objc).
