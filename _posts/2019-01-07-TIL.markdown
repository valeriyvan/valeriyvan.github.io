TIL keystrokes for Bash for clearing command line:
* **Ctrl+U** to clear up to the beginning;
* **Ctrl+W** to delete just a word;
* **Ctrl+C** to cancel;
* **Alt+Shift+\#** to make input a comment and keep it in history.

Note to future self with macOS command line to clone permissions: ```chmod ``stat -f %A fileWithPerm`` fileToSetPerm```.
