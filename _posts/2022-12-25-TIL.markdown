Have started [Udacity's Flying Car and Autonomous Flight Engineer course](https://www.udacity.com/course/flying-car-nanodegree--nd787).

First things learned, about [Drone code foundation](https://www.dronecode.org). Hm, Linux foundation support them. Dronecode supports open sourced projects. But ardupilot is not among them.
