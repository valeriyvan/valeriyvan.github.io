Read fun post by Jesse Squires [Agile by degrees: How to estimate engineering project timelines](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/how-to-estimate-engineering-project-timelines/). Worth keeping bookmark as it has a link on paper why humans are [naturally terrible at estimating](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/110201_throwing) for evolutionary reasons, as well as psychological ones â€” namely, the [planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy), [optimism bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias), and [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring).

Read another fun post by Jesse Squires [Summoning Lucifer: on making my first Mac app as an iOS developer](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/introducing-lucifer/).

Read post (russian) [Could user data monetization be a trend in 2019?](https://habr.com/ru/post/440164/). Bullshit.

Before writing `Operation` what I havn't done for several years, refreshed my knowledge by reading NSHipster post [`NSOperation`]([https://nshipster.com/nsoperation/).
