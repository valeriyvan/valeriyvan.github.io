Surprisingly, Apple has good enough information about use cases of pointers in Swift [UnsafeRawPointer Migration](https://swift.org/migration-guide-swift3/se-0107-migrate.html).

Watched WWDC 2020 session video [Use Swift on AWS Lambda with Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10644/).
