Learned [how to make private gist public](https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2011/05/making-private-gist-public.html) and that there's no need for that any more! Made public [Obj-C gist created many years ago](https://gist.github.com/valeriyvan/a70e8af69662ed58caef). TODO: made AWS Swift lambda for this coordinates transforms. Just for practicing with AWS lambdas.

Read [Binary Frameworks in Swift](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/binary-frameworks-swift/) by [Peter Steinberger](https://twitter.com/steipete):

Jumped (indirectly) to (quite old) [Are the Top Apps Using Swift?](https://medium.com/@ryanolsonk/are-the-top-apps-using-swift-42e880e7727f).

> I once again downloaded the top 100 free apps and wrote some scripts to analyze the .ipa files.

*Swift meetup question*: how people now download apps from the AppStore. Manually one by one? Hard to believe!

Read again [The Coordinator](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/) by Soroush Khanlou.

Then jumped to post of the Martin Fowler [Application Controller](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/applicationController.html).
