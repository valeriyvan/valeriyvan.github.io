TIL how to mount on a mac a folder from remote machine:

```
sudo sshfs -o 'allow_other,gid=NNN,uid=MMM' user-on-remote@remotehost:/folder /mountpoint/folder
```

TIL `id` CLI command which among others prints numeric values for user id (UID) and group id (GID). I needed these for `sshfs`.


Mount point for `sshfs` should be preliminary created as:

```
sudo mkdir -p /mount/point
sudo chown -R $USER:staff /mount/point/
```

I don't get why chown is needed. For me it didn't change any rights.

I don't know if `sshfs` needs any fuse software for its use. I installed previously [extFS from Paragon](https://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-mac/) to be able to read flashcards formatted for Linux.

It's interesting that [extFS from Paragon](https://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-mac/) is the only software for mac to read/write Linux volumes which I was able to make work. And it costed me 39.95$. It's might be viable idea to make an app for this. It's about implementing linux FUSE interface. Mounting volumes from cloud services like Google Cloud or S3 bucket - another application where FUSE could be used. [CloudMounter works this way](https://mac.eltima.com/what-is-fuse.html).

TIL what FUSE stands for in macFuse, fuseFS and so on. FUSE stands for Filesystem in Userspace which originates in Linux. [How to mount and manage non-native file systems in OS X with FUSE](https://www.macworld.com/article/224627/how-to-mount-and-manage-non-native-file-systems-in-os-x-with-fuse.html).
