TIL [periphery](https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery) to find dead Swift code. Ran it against [swift-geometrize](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize). It really shows not used stuff whci could be eliminated.

TIL [Bullet Physics SDK](https://pybullet.org/)  Physics SDK: real-time collision detection and multi-physics simulation for VR, games, visual effects, robotics, machine learning etc.
