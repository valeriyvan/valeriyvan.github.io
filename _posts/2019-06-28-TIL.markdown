Read new fast.ai course outline [Deep Learning from the Foundations](https://www.fast.ai/2019/06/28/course-p2v3/). Sounds interesting. But it's considered second part. Probably I should start with it.

Tried [FFTW library C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)](http://www.fftw.org). Succeeded to build it for iOS with this [bash script](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55610893/942513) with minor changes. But failed to successfully run fftw and get out verifiable output.
