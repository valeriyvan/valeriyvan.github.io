I was confused today I cannot access regular string of `AttributedString` in Swift. In case of `NSAttributedString`, it was trivial as `NSAttributedString` is subclass of `NSString`. I haven't found straight way in documentation so I googled. Thread in swift forums [AttributedString to String](https://forums.swift.org/t/attributedstring-to-string/61667) mentions only what I've got from documentation - go over characters view:

```swift
let string = String(attributedString.characters)
```

I could add one more way - use `NSAttributedString` as middleware:

```swift
let string = NSAttributedString(attributedString).string
```
