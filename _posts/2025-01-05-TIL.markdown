TIL [`qrtool`](https://lib.rs/crates/qrtool), a command-line utility for encoding or decoding QR code. Impressively, it can even display generated QR codes directly in the terminal.

TIL [QRCode](https://github.com/dagronf/QRCode), quick and beautiful macOS/iOS/tvOS/watchOS QR Code generator/detector library for SwiftUI, Swift and Objective-C.  It supports SwiftUI, Swift, and Objective-C and seems far more robust than CodeScanner by @twostraws (Paul Hudson).
