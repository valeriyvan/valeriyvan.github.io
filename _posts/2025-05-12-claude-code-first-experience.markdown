First tried to use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

```bash
claude -p "explain this project"
Based on the directory structure, this appears to be a Jekyll-based blog website known as "Today I Learned" (TIL). The site contains hundreds of dated posts in markdown format, organized chronologically from 2018 to 2025, where the author documents things they learned each day.

The website uses Jekyll, a static site generator that transforms markdown files into a complete website. It has standard Jekyll components like layout templates, includes, and configuration files. The posts follow a consistent naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD-TIL.markdown).

The site also includes assets like images, PDFs (technical papers), CSS styling, and scripts.
