Read [`UIAppearance` seems not to be that simple](https://habr.com/ru/post/453126/). `UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR` - I have never ever met such a beast.

Read [Architecture of networking core in iOS app](https://habr.com/ru/post/309990/).

Passed over [Face Recognition with OpenCV](https://www.objc.io/issues/21-camera-and-photos/face-recognition-with-opencv/) just because accidentally found it was written by Engin Kurutepe from UIKonf.

Watched UIKonf 2019 talk [Advanced Colors in iOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKRkSbkS0zg) by Neha Kulkarni.

Watched UIKonf 2019 talk [*Promises* in iOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKRkSbkS0zg) by Anne Cahalan.
* *Future* is readonly placeholder for unknown future value.
* *Promise* is writable single assignment container.

Watched very interesting UIKonf 2019 talk [Muse Prototype Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKRkSbkS0zg) by Julia Roggatz. Nice work! A little bet more information [here](https://www.inkandswitch.com//muse-studio-for-ideas.html).
