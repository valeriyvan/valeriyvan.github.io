Read [Face it: you're a crazy person. OR: why your brain needs a boxcutter](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/face-it-youre-a-crazy-person). A teaser:

> I meet a lot of people who don’t like their jobs, and when I ask them what they’d rather do instead, about 75% say something like, “Oh, I dunno, I’d really love to run a little coffee shop.” If I’m feeling mischievous that day, I ask them one question: “Where would you get the coffee beans?”
