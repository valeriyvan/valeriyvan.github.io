From [In-flight propulsion system test](http://shrediquette.blogspot.com/2018/04/in-flight-propulsion-system-test.html) got brilliant idea how to compare different propellers in flight. The site [Shrediquette - the award-winning multirotors by William Thielicke](http://shrediquette.blogspot.com) is interesting and contains a lot of info about different self built drones. The guy seems to be from Bremen, Germany.

Great 3 parts serie [Side Force Generators (SFGs) in FPV Racing](http://shrediquette.blogspot.com/2017/10/side-force-generators-sfgs-in-fpv-racing.html), [Part 2/3: Side force generators - Forces and turning](http://shrediquette.blogspot.com/2017/11/side-force-generators-detailed.html), can't find part three.

Read [Some thoughts on FPV camera tilt compensation](http://shrediquette.blogspot.com/2016/01/some-thoughts-on-camera-tilt.html) and [Explanation video: FPV camera tilt compensation](http://shrediquette.blogspot.com/2016/01/explanation-video-fpv-camera-tilt.html).

Bowsed paper [Yaw/Heading optimization by drift elimination on MEMS gyroscope](/assets/docs/Yaw-Heading-optimization-by-drift-elimination-_2021_Sensors-and-Actuators-A-.pdf).
