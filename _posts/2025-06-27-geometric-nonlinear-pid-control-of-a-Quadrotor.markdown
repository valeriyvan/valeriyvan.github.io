Came across an interesting PR [Updates to the Lee Controller](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/pull/1494) into [crazyflie-firmware](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware). It refers a papers [Control of Complex Maneuvers for a Quadrotor UAV using Geometric Methods on SE(3)](/assets/docs/Control%20of%20Complex%20Maneuvers%20for%20a%20Quadrotor%20UAV%20using%20Geometric%20Methods%20on%20SE(3).pdf) and [Geometric Nonlinear PID Control of a Quadrotor UAV on SE(3)](/assets/docs/Geometric%20Nonlinear%20PID%20Control%20of%20a%20Quadrotor%20UAV%20on%20SE(3).pdf).
