I'll point [NSHipster's Bundles and Packages](https://nshipster.com/bundles-and-packages/) when have to explain someone difference between bundles and packages. Fuck, `localizedInfoDictionary` func exists on instance of Bundle, could be used like `Bundle.main.localizedInfoDictionary["CFBundleName"]`.
