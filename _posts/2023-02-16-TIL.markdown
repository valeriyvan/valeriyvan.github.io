Watched [Crazyflie AI-deck Workshop 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9asYPHxEB4). For me worth watching since 28:00. Or better even since 40:00. Has interesting stuff like [streaming images from AI-deck over WiFi](https://github.com/bitcraze/aideck-gap8-examples/tree/master/examples/other/wifi-img-streamer). Repo for workshop - [AI deck workshop](https://github.com/pulp-platform/AI-deck-workshop). 

As I get from the workshop, Crazyflie's AI-deck is kind of clone of what is called PULP (Parallel Ultra Low Power). [PULP datasheet](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp/blob/master/doc/datasheet.pdf).

Watched lecture [Bitcraze - Crazyflie 101 EPFL-LIS lecture - part 1 (2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-SLP3WWl0&t=168s).
