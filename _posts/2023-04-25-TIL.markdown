Nothing new or interesting. Thanks God, `NSString` in Objective-C and `String` in Swift are extremely good designed pieces of software.

Read, probably, not the first time, [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/). Hm, this page is 20 years old.
