Read [Memory management when using async/await in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/memory-management-when-using-async-await/).

Read [Autonomous flight of the micro drone Crazyflie 2.1 through an obstacle course](/assets/docs/Autonomous%20flight%20of%20the%20micro%20drone%20Crazyflie%202.1%20through%20an%20obstacle%20course.pdf) which seems to be report on research work done by students.
