Read [Xcode Build Configuration Files](https://nshipster.com/xcconfig/). How you to use text-based [`xcconfig`](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/8.3/#/dev745c5c974) - that's what I always wanted to know.

Side note. I have never heard about `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`:

> According to the POSIX standard environment variables have names consisting solely of uppercase letters, digits, and underscore ( _ ) â€” a convention I like to call SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

Read [Image Resizing Techniques](https://nshipster.com/image-resizing/). It's not only about resizing but also about downsampling as well.

This calculation is smart! Usually I calculate ratio and then multiply sizes to that ratio. Using `CGAffineTransform` is smart!

```swift
let scaleFactor = UIScreen.main.scale
let scale = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: scaleFactor, y: scaleFactor)
let size = imageView.bounds.size.applying(scale)
