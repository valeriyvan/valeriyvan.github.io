Read chapter [Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html) of The Swift programming language guide. `catch is VendingMachineError` - is what I have missed before.

Read [Popovers, UINavigationController, and preferredContentSize](https://noahgilmore.com/blog/popover-uinavigationcontroller-preferredcontentsize/). Relevant topic for current task.
