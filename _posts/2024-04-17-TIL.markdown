TIL [3D printing is called additive manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing).

TIL about [3MF 3D Manufacturing Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Manufacturing_Format).

> 3MF is an XML-based data format designed specifically for additive manufacturing. It includes information about materials, colors, and other information that cannot be represented in the STL format.

Microsoft is part of consortium behind 3MF therefore format is natively supported on Windows. macOS lucks native QuickLook viewer and I failed to find working third-party one. 3MF is XML, part describing 3D object structure is not complex. Theoretically it wouldn't be difficult to convert 3MF into STL inside QuickLook.

[3MF 3D Manufacturing Format](https://github.com/3MFConsortium/spec_core) is open source, [lib3mf](https://github.com/3MFConsortium/lib3mf), a C++ implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file standard is opensource either.
