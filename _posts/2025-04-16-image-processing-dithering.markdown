Read [a dither algorithm](https://pippin.gimp.org/a_dither/) — a fascinating deep dive into dithering techniques. The entire site, [pippin.gimp.org](https://pippin.gimp.org/), is a goldmine of creative and technical projects. Highlights include [squoze – unicode encodings for pointers and hashes](https://squoze.org), and the textbook [Image Processing with gluas](https://pippin.gimp.org/image-processing/) — *"text tries to explain the craft of digital alteration and conjuring of images to your own liking. It attempts doing so from a programmers mind-set rather than a mathematical one."*  I'd love to create something similar in Swift and make it accessible on the web.
