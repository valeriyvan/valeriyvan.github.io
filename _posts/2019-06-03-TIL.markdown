WTH this `catch(...)` is???

```C++
    catch (CAXException &e) {
        NSLog(@"Error returned from setupAudioSession: %d: %s", (int)e.mError, e.mOperation);
    }
    catch (...) {
        NSLog(@"Unknown error returned from setupAudioSession");
    }
```

Found out it's [C++ feature](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/exceptions/), it's kind of default case for `catch` clauses.

Working with audio this week. Just checked if I understand [dB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) correctly.

Trying to brush up my understanding of Fast Fourier transform read [1](https://habr.com/ru/post/196374/) and [2](https://habr.com/ru/post/274175/).

Watched online [WWDC 2019 keynote](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/101/) and [Platforms State of the Union](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/103/). Downloaded Xcode 11 and played with it and SwiftUI.
