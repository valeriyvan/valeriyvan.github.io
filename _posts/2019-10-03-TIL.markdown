While procrastinating read [Why should you use language Ada to program your system (russian)](https://habr.com/ru/post/469671/). Curious to know that int and float in Ada has no range specifiers. Programmer has to define that.

Read [Build iOS-ready machine learning models using Create ML](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/build-ios-ready-machine-learning-models-using-create-ml-cf35091f6f8c).

Read [Machine Learning on iOS: Computer Vision](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/machine-learning-on-ios-computer-vision-b22469680f50), A catalogue of Heartbeat posts covering the use of computer vision-based machine learning tasks on iOS. Quite good selection! I should try some.
