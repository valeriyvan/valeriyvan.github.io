TIL new swift package [Swift HTTP Types](https://www.swift.org/blog/introducing-swift-http-types/) which provides a shared set of currency types for client/server HTTP operations in Swift. It's repo [swift-http-types](https://github.com/apple/swift-http-types).

Watched [Connecting Raspberry Pi w/ Pixhawk and Communicating via MAVLink Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGAB34fJQFc). It shows shortly how to communicate with flight controller with MAVProxy. Following screenshot saved my day:

In my case command launching MAVProxy was `~/mavlink/bin/mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyACM0 --baudrate 57600 --aircraft MyDrone`. Later I found out that all parameters could be omitted and `MAVProxy` launches fine without parameters.

TIL git has its own GUI which could be called with `git gui`.

Watched [02 Pymavlink Arm Command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M7e7DDLTQc).

Read section [Command Protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/services/command.html) of MAVLink documentation.
