Passed through [App form design best practices](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/mobile-app-forms-best-practices/). It has link to [Placeholders in Form Fields Are Harmful](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/) which I will hand over to designers I am working with.

Watched [Swift Talk #149 We use SwiftSyntax to add highlighting for Swift code blocks](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E149-swift-syntax-highlighting).
