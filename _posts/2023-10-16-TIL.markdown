TIL about `withLock` existing in all kinds of locks. It's strange I haven't encountered it before. It's declared in [NSLocking protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocking).

```swift
private let lock = NSRecursiveLock()
lock.withLock {
    state[keyPath: keyPath]
}
```

Set up [workflow to build and test swift-geometrize on Ubuntu](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-run-tests-ubuntu.yml). Side effect of this - [`install-swift.sh` script for installing Swift 5.9 on Ubuntu 22.04](https://gist.github.com/valeriyvan/4801ca8b727bfde5d573179063e79f67). Currently workflow installs dependencies with `apt-get` everytime it runs. That's waist of resources. It could be improved with [caching](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows). It looks a bit complicated. May be later I will [return to it](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize/issues/89).

I see this [GitHub Actions' Workflow for Swift Package](https://gist.github.com/YOCKOW/352b3594bfcb2c06d953647adaf65e78) which builds Swift package on both Ubuntu 22.04 and macOS and uses caching for dependencies. A bit more complex Action [Swift Setup](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/swift-setup) of the same author in Actions marketplace. May be I should just use it.

This is nice Action [Swift Release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/swift-release) for releasing Swift package.

TIL how strange YAML syntax is that it needs dedicated website to explain [how to make multi-line string in YAML](https://yaml-multiline.info). I needed multi-line string for incorporating Swift install commands into GitHub workflow.
