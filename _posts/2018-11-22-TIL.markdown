Read [Swift: Why You Should not Use Default Implementations in Protocols](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-use-default-implementations-protocols/) and its friend [Swift: Alternative to Default Implementations in Protocols](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-alternative-to-default-implementations-in-protocols/).

Watched [WWDC 2018 401 session video What's New in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/401/). I watched it already. But here are things which seem new for me:

-   `SWIFT_DETERMINICTIC_HASHING`
-   `Int.random(in: 0..<10)`
-   `Float.rand(in: -10.0..<10.0)`
-   `RandomNumberGenerator` protocol which could be passed to random and
    shuffled
-   `#if canImport(UIKit)`
-   `#if hasTargetEnvironment(simulator)`

Watched [WWDC 2018 403 session video What's New in Testing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/403/). Nothing new this time, or, better say, nothing close to my current priorities.

Watched [WWDC 2018 703 session video Introducing Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/703/). Not first time. So nothing new this time. Should give it real try.
