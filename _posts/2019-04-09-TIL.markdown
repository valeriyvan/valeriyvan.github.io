Read about already accepted additions to `String` API in Swift [`String` Gaps and Missing APIs](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0248-string-gaps-missing-apis.md). Will appear in Swift 5.1.

> Slice, the default SubSequence type, provides `base` for accessing the original Collection. Substring, Stringâ€™s SubSequence, should as well.

Sounds like `ArraySlice` should also provide `base`, but it doesn't.

Went to [AI for Autonomous Mobility meetup](http://deep-berlin.ai/ai-for-autonomous-mobility-meetup/). There's time for [registration for robocar races until 30 of April](https://deepberlin.typeform.com/to/EAPTe6). Registered. Interesting link with [resources](http://deep-berlin.ai/2018/03/13/robocarsresources/).
