Watched [Stanford's CS193P Spring 2021 Lecture 2: Learning more about SwiftUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lahkdHEhW8) and [Lecture 3: MVVM and the Swift type system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--qKOhdgJAs). I like it! Once per several years I watch these couse updated and every time I enjoy it.
