Yesterday I was asked at job interview which style guide I use for Swift. I don't know which one. I don't know even which exist. I definitely use some because I can't refrain from fixing function call to trailing closure syntax or to add space before opening curly brace. The question is what's the name of style guide I use. I started to google to name swift style guides available.

1. [Google's Swift Style guide](https://google.github.io/swift/) which is based on Apple’s Swift standard library style. Now I know which style guide I use: Apple’s Swift standard library style. Or one required by default by swiftlint tool.

1. [The Official raywenderlich.com Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).

1. [Linkedin Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/linkedin/swift-style-guide).

1. [Coursera Swift coding guidelines](https://github.com/coursera/swift-style-guide). Wow, it's so short!

And that's it!

[Swift.org](http://swift.org) has [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/), which should be mentioned here.

A book [Swift Style: An Opinionated Guide to an Opinionated Language by Erica Sadun](https://pragprog.com/book/esswift/swift-style) should be mentioned. But because the book is of 2017 and style itself is not available without buying a copy of book, this doesn't count.
