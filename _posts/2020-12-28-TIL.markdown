Watched video [PRECISION LANDING &#124; with OPENCV and ARUCO Markers &#124; Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlT_0fhGrGg) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iezU2PR0hBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iezU2PR0hBk).

Learned that Python has its own built in IDE named IDLE. To launch it, first, python interpreter sholuld be launched, then in it `import idlelib.idle` triggers IDLE launching.
