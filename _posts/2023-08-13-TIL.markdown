Wasted time trying to launch [BLHeli Configurator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blheli-configurator/mejfjggmbnocnfibbibmoogocnjbcjnk). It just doesn't run on macOS anymore. There are lot of posts searching for help how to launch it on macOS. There's open source for it: [blheli-configurator](https://github.com/blheli-configurator/blheli-configurator). It's not maintained. Building instruction are tedious as for Apple developer. Might be commercially viable idea to make paid app for this.
