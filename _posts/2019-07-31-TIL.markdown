Don't laugh. TIL [git clean](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean).

Found out Fortran 77 still exists, Fortran compiler is installed on OSX by default and there's something which still using it.

Curious if it is possible to write generic function in Swift which uses [vDSP_mtrans](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/1449988-vdsp_mtrans) or [vDSP_mtransD](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/1450422-vdsp_mtransd). I need versions for `Float` and `Double` but don't like to have two implementations.
