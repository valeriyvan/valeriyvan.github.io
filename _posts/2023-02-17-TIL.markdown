TIL [Bitonic sorter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter). Came accross interesting implementation of bitonic sorting for [Intel, offical from Intel](https://github.com/intel/x86-simd-sort) and ARM [A fast vectorized sorting implementation based on the ARM scalable vector extension (SVE)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8627236/), (A fast vectorized sorting implementation based on the ARM scalable vector extension (SVE))[https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07782] (SVE is not supported by Apple silicon), [Basic principles and bitonic sorting in official ARM's Neon programmers' guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0018/a/NEON-Code-Examples-with-Optimization/Median-filter/Basic-principles-and-bitonic-sorting). One time I will add these implementations to Swift.
