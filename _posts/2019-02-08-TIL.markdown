[The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/). It's actually questions how employer could be evaluated.

This is fun [The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/03/23/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing/). It cynical and humorous.
