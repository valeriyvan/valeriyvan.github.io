Played with [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org) while thinking of adding some SIMD optimizations to Swift. Read [How it works: Compiler Explorer](https://xania.org/201609/how-compiler-explorer-runs-on-amazon). Really cool stuff. Surprizing it works on single Amazon EC2 instance most of the time.
