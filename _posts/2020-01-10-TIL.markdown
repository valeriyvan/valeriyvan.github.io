Tried to play with [Tutorial Create images from rectangular shapes in the user's environment, and augment their appearance.](https://github.com/martco/altered-beast) referenced in [Fritz AI mail list](https://www.fritz.ai). But CoreML model is missing there.

Read [Advancements in Apple’s Vision Framework: 2019 Year-in-Review](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/advancements-in-apples-vision-framework-2019-year-in-review-4c9d3ad5b138).

Read [String Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/StringManifesto.md). Despite it's old, Swift 4, it's interesting. 

> Despite its name, `CharacterSet` currently operates on the Swift `UnicodeScalar` type. This means it is usable on `String`, but only by going through the unicode scalar view. To deal with this clash in the short term, `CharacterSet` should be renamed to `UnicodeScalarSet`. In the longer term, it may be appropriate to introduce a `CharacterSet` that provides similar functionality for extended grapheme clusters. 

Working on new release of [Motivation](https://github.com/valeriyvan/Motivation), read NSHeapster's [`DateComponents`](https://nshipster.com/datecomponents/).
