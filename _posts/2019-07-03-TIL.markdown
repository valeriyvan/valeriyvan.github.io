Read NSHipster's [Swift Property Wrappers](https://nshipster.com/propertywrapper/). Despite useful info on topic this post has chart showing connection between protocols and structs conforming to them which define number types in Swift. Same about `String` and `Substring`. This information is difficult to find anywhere else. I like this conclusion in post because I find myself feeling the same:

> Swift is a much, much more complex language than Objective-C. Thatâ€™s been true since Swift 1.0 and has only become more so over time.

Read with joy NSHipster's [Exhaustive rundown of the many faces of `@`](https://nshipster.com/at-compiler-directives/).

Jumped to [Attributes](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Attributes.html) of Swift language reference.
