Read about math behind different blend modes. Then I attempted to implement [snapshotting strategy on `Bitmap`](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize/blob/main/Tests/geometrizeTests/BitmapDiffing.swift) in [swift-geometrize](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize) library which I port to Swift.
