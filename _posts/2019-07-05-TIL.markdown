Read docs [simd](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/simd) library which is part of Accelerate framework. [Working with Vectors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/simd/working_with_vectors) gives interesting real life examples for color-to-grayscale conversion, calculate length and distance (Pythagorean theorem) and compare distances, calculate reflection and refraction vectors, calculate the normal of a triangle, interpolate between values. [Working with Matrices](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/simd/working_with_matrices) gives examples for solving simultaneous equations, transforming (translating, rotating, and scaling) vectors with matrix multiplication. [Working with Quaternions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/simd/working_with_quaternions) gives examples for rotating a point around a sphere, interpolating between two and multiple points on a sphere. Example code explains how to work with [quaternions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/simd/rotating_a_cube_by_transforming_its_vertices). [vForce](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/veclib/vforce) transcendental and trigonometric functions on vectors of any length, vectorised inside for current architecture, including exotics like `copysign`. I guess any vector imaging function one could imagine exists there.
