TIL [swift-testing-revolutionary](https://github.com/giginet/swift-testing-revolutionary) for converting test cases written in XCTest to [swift-testing](https://github.com/apple/swift-testing).

Read Wiki articles [Dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [Dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle).

> The principle states:[1]
>
>A. High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
>
>B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
