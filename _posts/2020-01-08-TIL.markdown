Read [Intriguing C++20 capabilities for embeded developers](https://habr.com/ru/post/536326/).

Read [New operator spaceship in C++20 (Russian)](https://habr.com/ru/company/microsoft/blog/458242/). Didn't get it.

Read [Comparisons in C++20](https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/07/28/comparisons-cpp20/). Didn't get either. But I like used [Carte Noire](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/carte-noire) them for Jekyll.

Read [Create a Command-Line Tool Using Swift Package Manager](https://medium.com/better-programming/create-a-command-line-tool-using-swift-package-manager-c2eb0e088e69).

Today I asked on interview what protocol oriented programming is. Then I tried to google how other flormulate this. Here is Paul Hudson's post [What is protocol-oriented programming?](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-protocol-oriented-programming). Nice header but post itself doesn't have answer to questeion in header.

Played with number plates detection online [Nomeroff Net Online Demo](https://nomeroff.net.ua/onlinedemo.html). [Project's home page](https://nomeroff.net.ua) which has full code, link to datasets.
