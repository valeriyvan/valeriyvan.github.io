Read [Intriguing C++20 capabilities for embeded developers](https://habr.com/ru/post/536326/).

Read [New operator spaceship in C++20 (Russian)](https://habr.com/ru/company/microsoft/blog/458242/). Didn't get it.

Read [Comparisons in C++20](https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/07/28/comparisons-cpp20/). Didn't get either. But I like used [Carte Noire](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/carte-noire) them for Jekyll.
