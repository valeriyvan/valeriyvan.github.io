TIL that since iOS 15 `BinaryFloatingPoint` has `formatted()`. Learnt that from [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/entering-numbers-with-stepper). It's possible to write:

```
Stepper("\(sleepAmount.formatted()) hours", value: $sleepAmount, in: 4...12, step: 0.25)
```
