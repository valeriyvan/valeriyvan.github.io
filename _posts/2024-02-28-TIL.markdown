TIL about image stippling. [WiKi page Stippling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stippling) is quite general. Here what is meant (the image is from [stippled-image repo](https://github.com/pshihn/stippled-image)):

Watched [Coding Challenge 181: Weighted Voronoi Stippling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxdt6T_1qgc). It's great! Would be nice make in Swift packages for Voronoi and for stippling images. Stippling is similar to dithering a bit.

Finally I know what FPV frame size means [All About Multirotor Drone FPV Frames](https://www.getfpv.com/learn/new-to-fpv/all-about-multirotor-fpv-drone-frame/):

> Each frame has a designated size class, based upon the longest distance from motor to motor measured in millimeters, typically taken by measuring diagonally across the frame. A frame measuring less than 150mm motor-to-motor is categorized as a micro. A frame larger than 150mm motor-to-motor is considered a mini. When measuring an unconventional multicopter frame, such as a hexacopter or tricopter, the size will always be given by the greatest motor-to-motor distance.

Browsed [Explaining Kalman Filters with the Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/2024/01/explaining-kalman-filters-with-the-crazyflie/).

> Excellent explainer! For those who want to delve a little deeper, or write their own EKF from scratch, I humbly suggest:

TIL difference between Cortex M and Cortex A. [ARM Cortex-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M)

> The main difference from Cortex-A cores is that Cortex-M cores have no memory management unit (MMU) for virtual memory, considered essential for "full-fledged" operating systems. Cortex-M programs instead run bare metal or on one of the many real-time operating systems which support a Cortex-M.
