TIl how pbm, pgm, ppm, pam images could be previewed on macOS:

`pnmtopng feep.ascii.p5.pgm | open -f -a Preview`

Preview of netpbm file with means of netpbm on macOS is important as macOS renders these file often incorrectly. E.g. as on following screenshot correct preview is on the bottom.

![Finder screenshot with wrongly rendered pgm file](/assets/images/Screenshot%202024-06-16%20at%2023.10.49.png "Finder screenshot with wrongly rendered pgm file")

Analogous pipe on Ubuntu will look like `pnmtoxwd /Users/valeriyvan/Downloads/surf.ascii.pgm | xwud`. This works on macOS as well if X Windows is installed.

Found dithering command line in netpbm - `pamditherbw`: `pamditherbw baboon.ascii.pgm | open -f -a Preview`.

This is the result of running `jpegtopnm ~/Desktop/me.jpg | ppmtopgm - | pamditherbw - | pnmtopng - | open -f -a Preview`:
![me dithered with pamditherbw](/assets/images/me%20dithered.png "me dithered with pamditherbw")
