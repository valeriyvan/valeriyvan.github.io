TIl how pbm, pgm, ppm, pam images could be previewed on macOS:

`pnmtopng feep.ascii.p5.pgm | open -f -a Preview`

Preview of netpbm file with means of netpbm on macOS is important as macOS renders these file often incorrectly. E.g. as on following screenshot correct preview is on the bottom.

Analogous pipe on Ubuntu will look like `pnmtoxwd /Users/valeriyvan/Downloads/surf.ascii.pgm | xwud`. This works on macOS as well if X Windows is installed.


Found dithering command line in netpbm - `pamditherbw`:

`pamditherbw baboon.ascii.pgm | open -f -a Preview`
