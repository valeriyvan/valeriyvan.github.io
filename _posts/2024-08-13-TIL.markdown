TIL [usvg](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/tree/master/crates/usvg), an [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) parser that tries to solve most of SVG complexity. It's part of [resvg](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg), an SVG rendering library. Some time ago I have looked for decent SVG parser.

TIL [esc-configurator](https://github.com/stylesuxx/esc-configurator) ([esc-configurator.com](https://esc-configurator.com)), a PWA (Progressive Web App) to flash BLHeli_S and AM32 based ESCs from the browser using the [Web-Serial API](https://wicg.github.io/serial/).

TIL [Ring Tone Text Transfer Language, RTTTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Tone_Text_Transfer_Language). Some ESC support RTTTL.

Read [bluejay ESC wiki](https://github.com/bird-sanctuary/bluejay/wiki).

Read [DSHOT - the missing Handbook](https://brushlesswhoop.com/dshot-and-bidirectional-dshot/). DSHOT is supported on all BLHELI_S, BLEHLI_32 and KISS ESCâ€™s.

Read [Anyone can Access Deleted and Private Repository Data on GitHub](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github): the implication here is that any code committed to a public repository may be accessible forever as long as there is at least one fork of that repository.
