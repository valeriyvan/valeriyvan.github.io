Came accross error while trying pip install some packages on macOS: [Tackling the “Externally Managed Environment” error while using Pip3](https://medium.com/@Po1s1n/tackling-the-externally-managed-environment-error-while-using-pip3-6d45b367c561).

TIL `COMMAND + SHIFT + .`` in Finder shows hidden forders.

Came accross `cd "$HOME" || exit 1` in bash script. It's smart to break script execution in case of error whithout explicit branching.
