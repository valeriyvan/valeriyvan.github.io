TIL [Amazon S3 vs EBS vs EFS](https://www.cloudberrylab.com/resources/blog/amazon-s3-vs-ebs-vs-efs/) differences between Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon EBS. Amazon S3 is a scalable, durable, highly available, publicly accessible data storage. Amazon EBS is a storage for the drives of your virtual machines. Amazon EFS is automatically scalable storage which you can mount EFS to various AWS services and access it from various virtual machines.

Browsed [Howto: Automated AWS spot instance provisioning with persisting of data](https://medium.com/@radekosmulski/automated-aws-spot-instance-provisioning-with-persisting-of-data-ce2b32bdc102) about automating acquiring AWS spot instance and run ML task on it. I should practice it.

Should examine [spotty github repo](https://github.com/apls777/spotty) if it universal and could actually run whatever I feed it.
