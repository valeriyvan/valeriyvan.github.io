TIL about [Xcode Releases](https://xcodereleases.com) with download links to all versions of Xcode.

TIL downloaded old version of Xcode couldn't be just run as earlier. [](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75109186/942513):
* Download the desired xcode version app from https://xcodereleases.com
* Unzip the app and rename it to `Xcode-<version>.app`;
* Move it to `/Applications` directory;
* Run xcode-select command: `xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-<version>.app`;
* Confirm that the correct Xcode version is selected with `xcode-select -p`.
