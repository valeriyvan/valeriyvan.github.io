What the fuck `Decimal` in Swift is? Why can't I just jump to its declaration in Xcode? Why should I google for it to find [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/decimal)? Well, it's old friend `NSDecimalNumber`. And sure, it's possible to find it in Xcode in Developer Documentation which is in Help menu. It's still regrets Xcode can't jump to source where it's declared.
