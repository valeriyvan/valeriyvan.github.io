Read [Phenomenological Introduction to PID controllers](https://vanhunteradams.com/PID/PID.html).

> This document focuses on building a phenomenological understanding of PID controllers through demos.

Read [Analytical Introduction to PID controllers](https://vanhunteradams.com/PID/PID_Analytical.html).

Watched [PID controller explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv6dLTEvl74), [What are PID Tuning Parameters?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ImhKwpSmuc), [How to Tune a PID Controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB1Ir4oCP5k). These are very good.
