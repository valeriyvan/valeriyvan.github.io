TIL about [comma.ai](https://comma.ai), an open-source autopilot project (openpilot) that aims to turn almost any car into a self-driving vehicle. Their approach to hiring is especially interesting - anyone can take on challenges or bounties to contribute.

Unfortunately, openpilot only supports vehicles with a CAN bus, which excludes BMWs and MINIs like mine. Otherwise, I'd definitely give it a try.  

Back in 2024, they tweeted ["It's time openpilot had a killer companion app, and we're hiring someone to build it"](https://x.com/comma_ai/status/1862940019327127765), but as of now, thereâ€™s still no app.
