Read Swift proposal [Extensions on bound generic types](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0361-bound-generic-extensions.md). Implemented in Swift 5.7. It's about writing
```swift
extension Array<String> { /* ... */ } 
```
instead of 
```swift
extension Array where Element == String { /* ... */ }
```

Watched WWDC 22 session video [Explore ShazamKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10044/). This definately could be used in [eNote app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/enote-intelligent-sheet-music/id1539408514) I have worked seveal years ago.
