Read [How to Open Websites Automatically with Automator](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/auto-open-websites-automator/).

I have googled exactly this: [What is the "bookmark" of my terminal when I touch the icon on my touchbar?](https://superuser.com/questions/1158816/what-is-the-bookmark-of-my-terminal-when-i-touch-the-icon-on-my-touchbar).

[Terminal User Guide: Use marks and bookmarks in Terminal on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/terminal/trml135fbc26/mac).

TIL [`with` keyword in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/with-statement-in-python/).

Followed [Nonblocking stdin read works differently in Python 3](https://ballingt.com/nonblocking-stdin-in-python-3/) developing keyboard control for drone.
