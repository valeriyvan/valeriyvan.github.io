Learning [dynamic time warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) algorythm. In Ukrainian it is called Алгоритм динамічної трансформації шкали часу.

Watched 5 times [How DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K1OsqCicBY), than three times [Dynamic Time Warping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOevFKQIjQ). The last is much better and explains how to handle signals of different lengths.

Read [Dynamic Time Warping with Time Series](https://medium.com/@shachiakyaagba_41915/dynamic-time-warping-with-time-series-1f5c05fb8950).

Googling for Dynamic Time Warping accidentally have found [Speech recognition for dummies (russian)](https://habr.com/en/post/226143/). Post of noob for noobs. But I find it interesting. It has:
* explanation of .wav file format;
* how detect periods of silence in sound calculating signal entropy;
* what Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are and how to calculate them.

Read interesting post [Video with cloud based object detection of Raspberry Pi (russian)](https://habr.com/ru/post/485406/).
