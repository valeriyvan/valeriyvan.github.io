TIL [what does `!$` mean in shell](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/254571). `!` means the last command used, `$` - the last word. So `!$` means the last word of the last command.

TIL [Digital Ocean App Platform](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps), it's possible to write this apps in Swift: [App Platform sample Swift application](https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-swift).
