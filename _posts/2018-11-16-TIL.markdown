Watched [WWDC 2018 session video 408 Building faster in Xcode 10](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/408/). Somehow `xcodebuild -showBuildTimingSummary` doesn't work for me. It just rebuilds project. Nothing else really interested.

Watched [WWDC 2018 session video 401 What's New in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/401/).

Interesting finding [Guides to contributing to Apple/Swift](https://modocache.io). Some posts are only available for patrons.
