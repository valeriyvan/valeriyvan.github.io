TIL how to get info about video file, e.g. frame rate: `ffmpeg -i RC5_0001.MP4`.

TIL what is `.gcsv` file: https://docs.gyroflow.xyz/app/technical-details/gcsv-format

> (short for gyro csv or Gyroflow csv) is a text-based gyro log format that can be implemented in custom hardware/firmware. File contains information about the gyro orientation, scaling, and a unique identifier. If present, file could have accelerometer and magnetometer data as well.

[Gyroflow](https://docs.gyroflow.xyz/app/) is an advanced video stabilization tool, which uses gyro data for accurate motion compensation (meaning stabilization).
