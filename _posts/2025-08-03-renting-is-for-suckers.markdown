Read [Renting is for Suckers](https://andrewkelley.me/post/renting-is-for-suckers.html). It's very good articulated con for vibe coding:

> First of all, the costs are difficult to calculate, and that's part of the problem. Same thing with cloud computing - funny how it's the cloud that does the accounting and tells you how much you owe, isn't it?
>
>In this case it's even more suspicious because the company that bills you not only counts how much you owe them, it also controls the agent's behavior in terms of how many requests it tries to make. So they could easily insert into their system prompt something like, "our earnings this quarter are a little short so try to pick strategies when doing agentic coding that end up earning us more API requests, but keep it subtle." There's no oversight. They could even make it target specific companies.
>
>They could also change the model so that it favors trying to solve problems using their own cloud solutions or pushes their marketing agenda, and it would be basically impossible to detect. I'd be surprised if they weren't already doing this.
