[This quiz](https://www.objc.io/quiz/10/) about enums with raw values moved me to read about RawRepresentable. [Swift language guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html#ID149) says:

> Raw values can be strings, characters, or any of the integer or floating-point number types.

Which isn't true. To be continued.
