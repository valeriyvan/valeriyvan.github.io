TIL [The AT Protocol](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/10-18-2022-the-at-protocol). It has dedicated [Protocol website](https://atproto.com).

> The “AT Protocol” is a new federated social network. It integrates ideas from the latest decentralized technologies into a simple, fast, and open network.

> What’s a “federated” network? It’s a way for servers to communicate with each other — like email. Instead of one site running the network, you can have many sites. It means you get a choice of provider, and individuals and businesses can self-host if they want.

Watched [Bitcraze Dev meeting July 2023 about simulating Crazyflie in Webots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yneriZeUwqY).

Dug in [Coco dataset](https://cocodataset.org) a bit. It has very nice interface for [explore mode](https://cocodataset.org/#explore). Would be nice to create something similar for my Ukrainian traffic signs dataset.

Browsed all [documentation for Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/foreword).

Read interesting post [Aibo and Webots: Simulation, wireless remote control and controller transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889006000327).

Watched [Installation and Introduction to Webots &vert; Make your first custom world in minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CWHfbuEbAY&list=PLt69C9MnPchkLuNNc4q9SeMFA96_v4THJ&index=1) from playlist [Webots Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt69C9MnPchkLuNNc4q9SeMFA96_v4THJ).

It took me a while to find how do I launch Guided Tour on Mac.
