Failed to make Swift work on Windows 10. [Swift Forums: Having error compiling a simple hello.swift on Windows 10](https://forums.swift.org/t/having-error-compiling-a-simple-hello-swift-on-windows-10/61556).

What I have learned that to compile Swift source on Windows I should run `swiftc -emit-executable -o hello.exe hello.swift`.

`swift hello.swift` is not compiling. What's it doing then?
