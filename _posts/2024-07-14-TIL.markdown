TIL [https://github.com/swiftlang/swiftly](`swiftly`) - s Swift toolchain installer and manager, written in Swift.

[Building a sub 250g Autonomous Drone with Ardupilot and ExpressLRS AirPort Telemetry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ArriXbrR0). Interesting install with separate pair of ExpressLRS in AirPort mode for telemetry which allow to use Mission Planner to control drone during the flight.
