From [swift-numerics package](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics) learned how to organize package with internal dependencies [Package.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics/blob/main/Package.swift). I am going to follow this pattern to [get rid of symlinks in swift-png package](https://github.com/kelvin13/swift-png/issues/35).

Read Swift Forum thread [Should I stick with Codable or switch back to NSCoding?](https://forums.swift.org/t/should-i-stick-with-codable-or-switch-back-to-nscoding/61604).
