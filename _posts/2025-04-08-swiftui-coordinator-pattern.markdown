Read [Coordinators & SwiftUI. Can we apply Coordinator approach for SwiftUI?](https://vbat.dev/coordinators-swiftui). I find article a bit inconsistent if you try to follow it.

Read [DI in SwiftUI](https://vbat.dev/di-in-swiftui).

TIL [swift-navigation](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-navigation) package by Point-Free. Didn't like it.
