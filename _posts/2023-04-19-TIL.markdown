Read [Automating Swift command line tool releases with GitHub Actions](https://www.polpiella.dev/automating-swift-package-releases-with-github-actions/). Good tutorial to automate Homebrew releases.

TIL what is [Punycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode).

TIL [Swift Power Asserts (also known as diagrammed assertions)](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/swift-power-assert). It allows asserts like:

```swift
#expect(max(a, b) == c)
        |   |  |  |  |
        7   4  7  |  12
                  false
```
