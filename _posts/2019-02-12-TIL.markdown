Findings of the day:

* `String` has `sorted()` returning `[Character]`. First, I wasn't expecting it having this at all. Second, I wasn't expecting this func return array of characters but not a `String`. Probably I should examine all `String` API. Haven't done this in a while.

* `Array` of `Equatable` is `Equatable`. This is logical. But I remember implementing this on my own sime time ago. Interesting to find which Swift version broght this.
