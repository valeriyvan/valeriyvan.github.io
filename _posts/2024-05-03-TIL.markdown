Diving into the [Netpbm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/netpbm/) sources as I'm currently endeavoring to enhance [swift-geometrize](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize)'s capability to read and write `.PPM` files, I stumbled upon the `dither.h` source file. Quite intriguing! Within it, I discovered a reference to the book ["Digital Halftoning" by Robert Ulichney, MIT Press, ISBN 0-262-21009-6](https://archive.org/details/digitalhalftonin00ulic/). This book is rooted in the [PHD thesis (1986) Digital Halftoning and the Physical Reconstruction Function](/assets/docs/PHD%20thesis%20Digital%20Halftoning%20and%20the%20Physical%20Reconstruction%20Function%20by%20Robert%20A.%20Ulichney.pdf). From what I could discern, both the book and the thesis are closely intertwined in terms of content. I'll retain these references for when I integrate dithering into [swift-geometrize](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize).

When I searched for a "Digital Halftoning" book, I stumbled upon ["Beyond Photography: The Digital Darkroom" by Gerard J. Holzmann](/assets/docs/Book%20Beyond%20Photography.%20The%20Digital%20Darkroom.%20Gerard%20J.%20Holzmann.pdf), published in 1988, the same year I began my studies. It contains numerous intriguing examples of bitmap transformations that could be worth reproducing, either within `swift-geometrize` package or as part of a separate `Bitmap` package.
