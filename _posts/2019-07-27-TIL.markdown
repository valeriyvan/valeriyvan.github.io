Read [Core Audio Introduction](https://medium.com/@kardakov/core-audio-introduction-3ce40b7b9066), [Core Audio: don’t forget the headphones](https://medium.com/@kardakov/core-audio-dont-forget-the-headphones-bfbf32b8326f), [Core Audio: Sampling](https://medium.com/@kardakov/core-audio-sampling-54c97e4994ea).

Read [Improve your iOS team’s productivity by building features as frameworks](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/improve-your-ios-teams-productivity-by-building-features-as-frameworks-9d2a64cbcab5). Probably it's the path we will follow nearest weeks.

Read [Why you should stop using Git rebase](https://medium.com/@fredrikmorken/why-you-should-stop-using-git-rebase-5552bee4fed1).
