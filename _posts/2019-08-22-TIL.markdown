Preparing requirements for this screen learned what [frequency response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response) [(russian амплитудно-частотная характеристика)](https://samesound.ru/g/instruments/89208-frequency-response-explain) is. I havn't literally meant "learned". I have learned that when I was in school 40 yeas ago. And yes, this screen isn't connected directly with notion of frequency response.

Learned difference between accessibility identifiers and accessibility labels.
