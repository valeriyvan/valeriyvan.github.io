I finally found confirmation that ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers) for brushless motors regulate speed not by varying voltage but by controlling the timing of current pulses sent to the motor’s windings: [Wiki: Electronic speed control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_speed_control).

I came across an excellent article, [What is an Electronic Speed Controller & How Does an ESC Work](https://www.tytorobotics.com/blogs/articles/what-is-an-esc-how-does-an-esc-work). It mentions that some ESCs may regulate speed by varying voltage, which I assume applies to ESCs designed for brushed motors.

> the role of the ESC is to deliver power from the battery to the motor in a controlled manner. If you input 50% throttle on the controller, the ESC will deliver 50% ‘power’ to the motor. What is ‘power’ depends on the firmware used. Some will use the average voltage sent to the motor, others use the speed target, and some use a mix of both.
