Found today that Swift inferring type mistakenly insists collection is heterogeneous.

![Swift insists collection is heterogeneous](/assets/images/Xcode-Screenshot%202023-10-08%20at%2015.07.45.png "Swift insists collection is heterogeneous")

But Swift is happy when type annotation is added.

I guess this edge case or not handled at all or handled incorrectly in Swift compile type inference.

Another case when Swift compiler diagnostic is dummy: Swift cannot get that literal array is a collection.

One more example of useless Swift diagnostic.
