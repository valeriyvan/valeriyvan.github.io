TIL [`wcurl`](https://github.com/curl/wcurl).

Watched nice tips [How to Reduce Log Verbosity in the Xcode Debug Console](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VCiEtyebLs).

TIL [`ipatool`](https://github.com/majd/ipatool), a command-line tool that allows searching and downloading app packages (known as ipa files) from the iOS App Store. Finally I got a tool for downloading ipa from the App Store.
