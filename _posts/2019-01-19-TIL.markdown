Watched [Swift talk \#135 about combined resource download](http://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E135-combined-resources-part-2). Is it coincidence that they discuss the same as Point free guys [in episode \#43 The Many Faces of Flat-Map: Part 2](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep43-the-many-faces-of-flat-map-part-2)?
