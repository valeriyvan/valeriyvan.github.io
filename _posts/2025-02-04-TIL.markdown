Read [Lazy navigation in SwiftUI](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2021/01/27/lazy-navigation-in-swiftui/). This didn't work for me.

Read [Lazy NavigationLink for SwiftUI](https://stevenpcurtis.medium.com/lazy-navigationlink-for-swiftui-6fa2ccd762bd). Much simpler solution which worked great for me.

Interesting: [Vigilante Justice on GitHub](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/vigilante-justice-on-github).
