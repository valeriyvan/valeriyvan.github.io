Experimented with [Creating a drag and drop uploader with preview in Javascript](https://applerinquest.com/how-to-preview-the-uploaded-image-in-javascript/) and [AJAX calls using Vapor 4](https://theswiftdev.com/ajax-calls-using-vapor-4/).

TIL GitHub exposes user's public keys under [https://github.com/username.keys](https://github.com/username.keys). `ssh git@github.com` checks if my keys are correct exposes my name to anyone who has my public key.
