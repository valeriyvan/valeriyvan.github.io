Read [Where the &$!#% is Localizable.strings?!?](https://martiancraft.com/blog/2018/11/where-is-localizable-string/).

Read [Clustarisation: algorithms k-means and c-means](https://habr.com/post/67078/). Post mentions XLIFF format which I was not aware of.

Read [Unit testing retain cycles](https://paul-samuels.com/blog/2018/11/20/unit-testing-retain-cycles). Nothing new. And I haven't got the last snippet.

Not practical but curious visualization of bezier curves [The Ever so Lovely BÃ©zier Curve](https://medium.com/@Acegikmo/the-ever-so-lovely-b%C3%A9zier-curve-eb27514da3bf).
