Read NSHipster's [API Pollution in Swift Modules](https://nshipster.com/swift-api-pollution/).

Ok, learned about existence of (`Numeric`)[https://swiftdoc.org/v4.2/protocol/numeric/]. This is very interesting [Swift's Numeric Protocol](https://swiftunboxed.com/protocols/numeric/).

SVG. These day I research existing solutions to render music score on iOS. One of solutions renders into SVG. What's SVG? 

> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.
