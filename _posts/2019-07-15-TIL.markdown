Passed [Dictionary and Set Improvements in Swift 4.0](https://swift.org/blog/dictionary-and-set-improvements/) as refreshment because encountered it in one of my searches googling for posts about implementation of dictionaries in Swift.

Read [Exploring Swift Dictionary's Implementation](http://ankit.im/swift/2016/01/19/exploring-swift-dictionary-implementation/) to which I came googling "open addressing with linear probing".

Side learning: `UnsafeMutablePointer` actually is much closer to pointer arithmetic in C then I thought:

```swift
var values: UnsafeMutablePointer<Value>
///
(values + i).initialize(v) // here values + i resembles C's pointer arithmetic
```
