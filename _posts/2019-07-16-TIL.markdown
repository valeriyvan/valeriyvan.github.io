Browsed post [Implementing Hash Table Algorithms in Swift](https://medium.com/swift-algorithms-data-structures/understanding-hash-table-algorithms-in-swift-3476828bea69) by Wayne Bishop, author of [Swift Algorithms & Data Structures book](https://www.amazon.com/Swift-Algorithms-Structures-Wayne-Bishop/dp/0692511768).

Browsed [Dictionary.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/e9d4687e31a3ae8e90604d3b15bf8b241479c211/stdlib/public/core/Dictionary.swift) from Swift stdlib. I understand this now "Native storage is a hash table with open addressing and linear probing". But don't understand this: "`Dictionary` does not use tombstones". What is tombstone in this context? Probably the answer could be found in Knuth's.

Following yesterday's note jumped to source of `KeyValuePairs` in Swift. Interesting data structure I didn't know about.
