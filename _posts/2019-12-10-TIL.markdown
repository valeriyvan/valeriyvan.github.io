Started day with reading again chapter [Access Control](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AccessControl.html) of The Swift programming language manual.

> A _module_ is a single unit of code distribution—a framework or application that is built and shipped as a single unit and that can be imported by another module with Swift’s import keyword.

> Each build target (such as an app bundle or framework) in Xcode is treated as a separate module in Swift. 

Read chapter [Inheritance](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Inheritance.html) of The Swift programming language manual.
