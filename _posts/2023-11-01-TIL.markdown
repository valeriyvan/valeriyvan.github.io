Installed [neovim-qt](https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt) on Ubuntu server and tried using it on server with X-forwarding GUI to my mac. Note to future self: it's launched with `nvim-qt`.

Read [Tired of crashing? Use Open Gimbal!](https://www.bitcraze.io/2023/10/tired-of-crashing-use-open-gimbal) by Bitcraze. It's brilliant idea.
