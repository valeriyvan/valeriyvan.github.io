GitHub recommended [swift-system package](https://github.com/apple/swift-system). Interesting stuff. Browsing came across `yeild` keyword in [`FilePathComponentView` source](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Sources/System/FilePath/FilePathComponentView.swift).

I jumped to the post [Yielding Accessors in Swift](https://trycombine.com/posts/swift-read-modify-coroutines/). The proposal [SE-0474: Yielding Accessors](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0474-yielding-accessors.md) is still under active review as of May 2025.
