Read again [Reporting test coverage for Swift packages without Xcode](https://medium.com/touchwonders/reporting-test-coverage-for-swift-packages-without-xcode-958ce9965abd).

```bash
swift test --enable-code-coverage --verbose
```

For me codecove files are in folder `./.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/codecov`

Read [Code coverage for Swift Package Manager based apps](https://bitrise.io/blog/post/code-coverage-for-swift-package-manager-based-apps).

Watched [15 \| Combine a gyroscope and accelerometer to measure angles - precisely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HuN9iL-zxU).

Read [Low-level Swift optimization tips](https://swiftinit.org/articles/low-level-swift-optimization).

> Reasonably well-written Swift code without any detailed optimization can easily achieve run time performance within 200 to 250 percent of a bare-metal C implementation.

Ha-ha. Twice slower than plane C.

Came accross nice tutorial [Quadcopter build and programming manual](https://github.com/CarbonAeronautics/Manual-Quadcopter-Drone) how to build Quadcopter from scratch, including PCB bouard for self made flight controller. It's so nice I checked in [Carbon Aeronautics Quadcopter Manual.pdf](/assets/docs/Carbon_Aeronautics_Quadcopter_Manual.pdf). Totorial has videos for each of chapters: [Carbon Aeronautics video channel](https://www.youtube.com/@carbonaeronautics).
