Have found strange declaration in SwiftUI sources as for me:

```swift
@available(macOS 10.15, iOS 13.0, tvOS 13.0, watchOS 6.0, *)
public typealias ObservableObject = ObservableObject
```

TIL [SwiftUI View's Instance Method `onChange(of:initial:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onchange(of:initial:_:)-4psgg)
