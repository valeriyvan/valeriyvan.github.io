TIL [Flamegraphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) which could be used for performance debugging.

Read some pieces of documentation of Swift-Server: [Debugging Performance Issues](https://github.com/swift-server/guides/blob/main/docs/performance.md), and [Allocations](https://github.com/swift-server/guides/blob/main/docs/allocations.md) both discuss Flamegraphs.

Followed with read [Build system](https://github.com/swift-server/guides/blob/main/docs/building.md) which describes how to build on macOS for Linux, and [Deploying to DigitalOcean](https://github.com/swift-server/guides/blob/main/docs/digital-ocean.md), [Deploying on Ubuntu](https://github.com/swift-server/guides/blob/main/docs/ubuntu.md), [Packaging Applications for Deployment](https://github.com/swift-server/guides/blob/main/docs/packaging.md).

Read [The Discrete Fourier Transform in live pictures for ninth graders](https://habr.com/ru/articles/912630/).
