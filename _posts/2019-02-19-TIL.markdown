Read [Swift code metrics](https://medium.com/@matsoftware/swift-code-metrics-ea9ebf85416f) about open source Python tool [available on GitHub](https://github.com/matsoftware/swift-code-metrics). It really has a lot of interesting metrics! But why Python and not Swift? Ok, would be nice to port it to Swift.
