After several years I have again project with [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

> Since the URL in the `.gitmodules` file is what other people will first try to clone/fetch from, make sure to use a URL that they can access if possible. For example, if you use a different URL to push to than others would to pull from, use the one that others have access to. You can overwrite this value locally with git config `submodule.DbConnector.url PRIVATE_URL` for your own use. When applicable, a relative URL can be helpful.
