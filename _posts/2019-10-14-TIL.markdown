Why `description` of `CGSize` in Swift is so stupid? TODO: fix it. But before try to understand if there is any reason output of `description` of `CGSize`  is so stupid.

From [`cp` command: right copying of folders with files in Linux (russian)](https://habr.com/ru/company/ruvds/blog/471092/) `cp -a /source/. /target` for copying all files from source to target not using wildcards. Not that easy topic as one could think.
