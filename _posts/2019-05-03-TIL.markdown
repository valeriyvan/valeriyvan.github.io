Passed through PR to Swift standard library [Use String’s underlying UTF-8 view for Float parsing](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24198)

Passed over Swift proposal [Generic Math(s) Functions](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0246-mathable.md). That would solve a problem I came across some time ago trying to add something to all numerical types without code duplication.

Passed over another Swift proposal [Approximate Equality for Floating Point](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0259-approximately-equal.md). This is great:
```swift
if x.isAlmostEqual(to: y) {
  // equal enough!
}

if x.isAlmostEqual(to: y, tolerance: 0.001) {
  // equal enough!
}

if x.isAlmostZero( ) {
  // zero enough!
}
```

Browsed "anti-pitch" [Just say “no” to protocols on structural types?](https://forums.swift.org/t/anti-pitch-just-say-no-to-protocols-on-structural-types/24043).

Interesting discussion [Adding more data structures to the standard library](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-more-data-structures-to-the-standard-library/23651) by guy preparing for Swift interview.
