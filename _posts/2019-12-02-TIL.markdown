Googled how to make xcode project file from cmake: [CMake Tutorial â€“ Chapter 2: IDE Integration](https://www.johnlamp.net/cmake-tutorial-2-ide-integration.html). This should remember:

`cmake -G "Xcode"`

This lists all the targets and all the build configurations set up in the Xcode project:

`xcodebuild -list`

This runs building:

`xcodebuild`

Interesting to know Google maintains [ios-cmake](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ios-cmake/).

Interesting info on topic: [How to include a CMake project in a Xcode project](https://blog.tomtasche.at/2019/05/how-to-include-cmake-project-in-xcode.html).
