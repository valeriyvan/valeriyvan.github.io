Brilliant idea - store where developer could buy template for app for quick start of development [iOS App Templates](https://www.iosapptemplates.com/).

Nice introduction to Combine [Problem Solving with Combine Swift](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/problem-solving-with-combine-swift-4751885fda77) with marble diagrams.
