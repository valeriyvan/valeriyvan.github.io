From [opensource app IceCubesApp for accessing the decentralized social network Mastodon](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp) learned the idea of putting development team ID and bundle id prefix into `xcconfig` file [IceCubesApp-release.xcconfig](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp/blob/main/IceCubesApp-release.xcconfig).

Passed over [Step-by-Step: Swarm Interface](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/user-guides/sbs_swarm_interface/) of Bitcraze. May be one time I will have several Crazyflies so I could follow the guide.
