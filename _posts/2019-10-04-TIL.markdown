Read [An in-depth look at Core ML 3](https://machinethink.net/blog/new-in-coreml3/):

> We’re mostly going to look at the mlmodel format here, not the API from CoreML.framework (which, except for adding training functionality, didn’t really change much).

> Do you need to know this stuff if you’re just looking to convert an existing model and use it in your app? Probably not. But it’s definitely good to have as a reference for when you’re designing your own machine learning models that you intend to use with Core ML 3, or when you’re not sure an existing model can be converted.
