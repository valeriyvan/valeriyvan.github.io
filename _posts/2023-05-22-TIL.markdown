TIL Swift 5.7 have added functions [`trimPrefix`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection/trimprefix(_:)) and [`trimmingPrefix`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/bidirectionalcollection/trimmingprefix(_:)-1luge?changes=l_3) to collections and sequences. Documentation is incorrect so [I have fixed it](https://github.com/apple/swift-experimental-string-processing/pull/673).
