TIL about [`dmgbuild`](https://pypi.org/project/dmgbuild/). It's one of dependencies of [qFlipper macOS app](https://github.com/flipperdevices/qFlipper). `dmgbuild` is a command line tool to create macOS disk images (aka .dmg files). While it is possible to create disk images easily enough from the command line using the `hdiutil` program that ships with macOS, there is no easy way to configure the appearance of the resulting disk image when the user opens it. `dmgbuild` allows for full customization of the resulting disk image, without relying on Finder, and without using deprecated APIs (like the Alias Manager functions).
