From GitHub's [We updated our RSA SSH host key](https://github.blog/2023-03-23-we-updated-our-rsa-ssh-host-key/) TIL about `jq` - commandline JSON processor.

```
jq can transform JSON in various ways, by selecting, iterating, reducing and
otherwise mangling JSON documents. For instance, running the command jq
´map(.price) | add´ will take an array of JSON objects as input and return the
sum of their "price" fields.

Hung a bit in [Apple Swift issue #55222 SIMD generates bad code for string processing use-cases
](https://github.com/apple/swift/issues/55222) looking on Godbolt for generated code. It's really looks bad. Would be interesting for experimenting if this code is faster then no-SIMD code.
