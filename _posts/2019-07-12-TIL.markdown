Read [Fast.ai’s Deep Learning from the Foundations with Swift for TensorFlow](https://medium.com/tensorflow/fast-ais-deep-learning-from-the-foundations-with-swift-for-tensorflow-3ee7dfb68387). [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) is updated for Swift for TensorFlow. Time to start it. And one more reminder tat there's [browser playground for S4TF](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift#getting-started).

Read about [swiftbrew](https://github.com/swiftbrew/Swiftbrew) a tool for installing command line Swift packages.
