Browsed [ARM64 Function Calling Conventions](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/iPhoneOSABIReference/Articles/ARM64FunctionCallingConventions.html).

Read why [growth factor 2 for array is rigorously the worst possible](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/FBVector.md#memory-handling).

Read [Are pointers and arrays equivalent in C?](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/10/21/are-pointers-and-arrays-equivalent-in-c/).

Results of two weeks fucking with [vDSP](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/vdsp?language=objc) are these spectrograms of 1000Hz sine and piano phrase:
