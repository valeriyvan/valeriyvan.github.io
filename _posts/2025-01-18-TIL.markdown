From the post [Add launch at login setting to a macOS app](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/LaunchAtLoginSetting/), I learned how a macOS app can add a menu item to the right side of the menu bar. These items are officially referred to as *menu extras*. Informally, apps that use this feature are often referred to as Menu Bar Apps.

Apple provides excellent documentation on the menu bar, including its structure and design principles, in [The Menu Bar](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar). This reminded me that I haven't revisited the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/getting-started) in quite some time.
