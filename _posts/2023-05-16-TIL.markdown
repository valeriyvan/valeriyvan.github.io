TIL what is [Hardened Runtime](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime).

Watched [bonus Threading Operations and Queues](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/w7-public/essentialdeveloper.com+iOS+Dev+Mentoring+%23013+-+Threading%2C+Operations%2C+and+Queues.mp4) of [iOS Architect Crash Course](https://iosacademy.essentialdeveloper.com/p/ios-architect-crash-course-orga0eb/).

TIL github somehow makes impossible mp4 files committed to repo be to played. So I have had to find a place to host media files. It would selfhosting on own server or on Digital Ocean Spaces or in AWS S3 bucket.

TIL S3 would be quite inexpensive alternative to storing files online. I have found out that one my S3 bucket exists since 2018 and I pay nothing for it for last years as data is not accessed. S3 pricing model could be chip for rarely accessed data in comparison to Digital Ocean 5$ per Space per month minimal price.
