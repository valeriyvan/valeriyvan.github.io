TIL `arp -a` discovers and lists devices in local network. Could be helpful if network has not too many devices connected.

```bash
arp -a
? (192.168.99.80) at dc:4a:3e:7d:dc:e8 [ether] on wlp5s0
? (192.168.99.101) at f2:b8:bb:a6:12:02 [ether] on wlp5s0

work.local (192.168.99.115) at b4:2e:99:93:c1:ac [ether] on wlp5s0
```

TIL `nmap` could be more helpful.

``` bash
nmap 192.168.99.0/24
