Read again source of [`\_StringObject` in Swift stdlib](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/stdlib/public/core/StringObject.swift). No way I could use this anywhere soon.

Firstly came across `rethrows` in Swift in [https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/stdlib/public/core/String.swift#L558](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/76c18c80664f752312d01865c5721067a8e31925/stdlib/public/core/String.swift#L558).

Jumped [How to use the rethrows keyword in Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-the-rethrows-keyword). I don't know why I didn't use it before.
