Serendipity led me to [libschrift](https://github.com/tomolt/libschrift), a lightweight TrueType font rendering library, which a candidate to be used for rendering fonts for [swift-geometrize](https://github.com/valeriyvan/swift-geometrize).

libschrift refers [suckless.org Philosophy](https://www.suckless.org/philosophy/)

> We are the home of quality software such as [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org), [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/), [st](https://st.suckless.org) and plenty of other [tools](https://tools.suckless.org), with a focus on simplicity, clarity and frugality. Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable. We believe this should become the mainstream philosophy in the IT sector. Unfortunately, the tendency for complex, error-prone and slow software seems to be prevalent in the present-day software industry. We intend to prove the opposite with our software projects.

[SwiftTrueTypeFont](https://github.com/benspratling4/SwiftTrueTypeFont) is one more candidate to explore for reading TrueType fonts.
