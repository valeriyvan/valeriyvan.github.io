Read first chapters from [“App Architecture” book by Chris Eidhof, Matt Gallagher, and Florian Kugler](https://www.objc.io/books/app-architecture/). I like this definition of App architecture from the book: “the structures and tools used to bring smaller components together to form an application. ”
