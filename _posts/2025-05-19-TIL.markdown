TIL [What is HDR (High Dynamic Range), anyway?](https://www.lux.camera/what-is-hdr/).
The first HDR is the "HDR mode" introduced to the iPhone camera in 2010.

> Apple and Google called this stuff "HDR" because "HDR Construction Followed By Automatic Tone Mapping" doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. But just to be clear, the HDR added to the iPhone in 2010 **was not HDR**. The final JPEG was an SDR image that tries to replicate what you saw with your eyes. Maybe they should have called it "Fake HDR Mode."
