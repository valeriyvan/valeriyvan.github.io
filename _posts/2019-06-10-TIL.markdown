Read [vDSP Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/vDSP_Programming_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html). How I miss this old format of Apple docs!

Re-watched now offline WWDC 2019 session #204 [Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First App](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/204/) with running all code in Xcode. Found three places where code couldn't match one on slides.
