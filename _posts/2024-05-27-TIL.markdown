[setjmp/longjmp are undefined behaviors in Swift](https://forums.swift.org/t/on-the-road-to-swift-6/32862/146?page=8) and [cannot be used with ARC Objective-C either](https://x.com/jckarter/status/528971489257984000).

Read [Netpbm Programming Library Errors](https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/liberror.html). libnetpbm or just exists app in case of any error (io error or broken file) or uses longjpm as alternative.

These two make libnetpbm unusable with Swift. The only way to use libnetpbm in Swift - port it into Swift.
