One-liner for listing remote git branches sorted by the last commit date for each branch ([gist with source](https://gist.github.com/jasonrudolph/1810768)):

```bash
for branch in `git branch -r | grep -v HEAD`;do echo -e `git show --format="%ci %cr" $branch | head -n 1` \\t$branch; done | sort -r
```
