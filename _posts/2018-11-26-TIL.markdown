Read [iOS 11: Machine Learning for everyone](http://machinethink.net/blog/ios-11-machine-learning-for-everyone/). Mostly it's self-advertising but has useful info as well.

Read [Why learn algorithms?](http://machinethink.net/blog/why-learn-algorithms/) with real examples when knowing algorithms needed for making real iOS app. Would be interesting to write same post about my experience.

Read [One-shot object detection](http://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection/). TODO: <http://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection-with-yolo>.
