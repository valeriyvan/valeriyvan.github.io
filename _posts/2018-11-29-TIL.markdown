Watched [A Guide to Turi Create](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/712/). Tried to create Jupyter notebook for training first model for object detector for traffic signs. Read [turicreate documentation](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/object_detection/) about object detector and preparing data.
