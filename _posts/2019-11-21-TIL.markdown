Read [Advanced Operators chapter of The Swift programming language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html).

By link jumped to quite old NSHipster post [Object Subscripting](https://nshipster.com/object-subscripting/).

Reading about `@objc` and `@objc(name)` jumped to [Attributes chapter of The Swift programming language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Attributes.html).

It's interesting that page by link above links to [Programming with Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC).

Read [Subscripts chapter of The Swift programming language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Subscripts.html).

> Subscripts are not limited to a single dimension, and you can define subscripts with multiple input parameters to suit your custom typeâ€™s needs.
