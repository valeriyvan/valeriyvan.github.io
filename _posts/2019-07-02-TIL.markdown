Watched videos of week 2 of course [Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/audio-signal-processing/stft-2-tjEQe).

Read post [Fourier Transform in action: detecting note frequency and recognizing separate notes (Russian)](https://m.habr.com/ru/post/247385/).
